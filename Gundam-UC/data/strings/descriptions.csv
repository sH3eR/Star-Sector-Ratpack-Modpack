gundam_gundam_alex_pilot,SHIP,"Late during the One Year War, the Earth Federation Forces realized that they had a major problem with their prototype RX-78-2 Gundam close combat mobile suit: its pilot. Gundam pilot Amuro Ray was an emerging Newtype, and his abilities to predict enemy movements and respond with lightning-fast reflexes were simply pushing the Gundam beyond its design limits. To correct this problem, the EFF set out to develop a new Gundam prototype (code-named Alex) capable of taking advantage of a Newtype's quick-reacting abilities. ",,,

gundam_zudah_pilot,SHIP,"In UC 0075, Zimmad Company and Zeonic Company competed for a contract to mass produce a mobile suit for the Principality of Zeon. Zimmadâ€™s EMS-04 Zudah lost to the design that was mass produced as the MS-05B Zaku I. The reason: despite having superior maneuverability to the Zaku I, a fatal flaw in the EMS-04â€™s high performance Jupiter engine caused it to explode when overexerted. Though there are rumors that some Luddic Path Radicalists managed to steal an LPC Blueprint, what those crazy fanatics may use it for is unknown, but likely nothing good.",,,
