MSS_Brawlerhead,SHIP,"An experiment done by mad geniuses, it combines the the Brawler's hull with a Hammerhead's head. With a shield wall system and active flares, its used as a defensive variant of the Hammerhead.",,,
MSS_Nailer,SHIP,"Light, fast and monstrous. These three words describe Mayasura's flagship frigate. The Nailer is a craft made for pursuing hard to chase targets with its infernium burn and twin Nail Cannons. Designed as a heavy counterpart to the Perryi, it has heavier armor and better firepower to match.",,,
MSS_Kontos,SHIP,"Rumoured to be one of the rare Mayasurian ships, the UAC for this ship has been kept a Hegemony secret after their raid on Mayasura. The Kontos is a well armed combat carrier with a suite of PD drones and two fighter bays. A highly powerful and expensive ship for its size, compared to contemporaries like the Condor and Drover.",,,
MSS_Mokarran,SHIP,"A famed Mayasurian battlecruiser, the Mokarran's design was inspired by the successful Hammerhead-class destroyer. Often the spearpoint of Mayasurian fleets, the battlecruiser shines in an aggressive attack role, thanks to its front-focused firepower and solid profile. However, it falls short in broadside and rearward weaponry and as such is succeptible to being surrounded - even if its weight belies its nimbleness. To compensate, a Mokarran rarely flies without a heavy escort. The amidships fighter bays are also most often equipped with heavy attack craft capable of warding off potential flankers. These qualities have earned the Mokarran its place as a symbol of power and fortitude, a reputation well-earned by its history in the field against the might of the Hegemony.",,,
MSS_Mokarran_HVB,SHIP,"This is a famous modification of the Mokarran, eschewing its fighter bays for more missile firepower with enlarged hardpoints in front of the ship. It was made as a signature ship for one of the simulated combat tournaments and custom-made for its winner after long and laborious modification process. Its maiden voyage was a disaster, with ship being lost in void of space for years... until it was found, restored to its former glory. Now it's ready to fight and won't back down, no matter the odds.

MSS_Crow,SHIP,"The Crow is an elite fighter outfitted with an experimental small scale damper field. A product of Mayasuran design, the Crow has more than enough armor to beat through piddly point defense weapon arrays. A perfect escort to bombers, a pair of crows can become an amazingly efficient bomber leader and soak up all the damage with the durability to match!",,,
MSS_Sarissa,SHIP,"A proud and noble ship, the Sarissophoroi is the vanguard of Mayasuran carrier groups. With innovative engineering, the iconic Eagle-class cruiser has been reimagined as a battlecarrier with powerful weaponry and fighters to match. It leaves most of the original design specifications untouched, and as such is still a hefty yet mobile cruiser with a good mix of armour, agility and gunplay. Perhaps a ""jack of all trades,"" it however lacks the full fighter complement of other dedicated carriers and rather is looked down upon by other factions as being ""master of none"". This fact is blissfully ignored by the Mayasuran navy, reassured by the Sarissophoroi's still respectable service record. Many officers pray for the privilege of captaining such a versatile and potent vessel.",,,
MSS_vigilance_carrier,SHIP,"The Peltast is based on the Vigilance hull and was designed to fill the role of a lightweight support vessel in Mayasuran fleets. Satisfying the navy's desire for a focus on fightercraft, the conversion replaces the frigate's usual missile payload with a cramped but functional fighter bay. The resulting vessel relies heavily on its fighters and quickly falters if engaged directly. Prohibitive logistical demands restrict it mostly to defense forces rather than attack fleets, although it does still make an exceptional skirmish, reconnaissance or support ship.",,,
MSS_Tiburo,SHIP,"Among the most elite units of Mayasura's arsenal, the Tiburo-class Heavy Frigate is one of the largest frigates in the Sector. An apex predator of its weight class, it excels at engaging larger craft and can even pressure light cruisers into a retreat when deployed in number or properly supported.",,,
,,,,,
MSS_Pilgrim,SHIP,"While meek and a bit stubby, the Caravan is for the bold Captain that decides to smuggle Volturnian Lobsters for a living. When approached from a distance, the Caravan looks as defenseless as a Colossus, an easy bounty for any pirate. But it's usually the last thing a pirate sees before they approach closely and get targeted by the Caravan's wide arcing highly customizable gun turrets. Lastly, the Caravan comes equipped with an Influence Minelayer, filled with highly explosive charges.",,,
MSS_Tachi,SHIP,"The Tachi heavy interceptor drone is the cheapest fightercraft available to the Mayasuran fleet, but proves that low cost does not always imply poor quality. Slower than some interceptors, the Tachi boasts superior armour and firepower, and while it is often outnumbered due to the low wing size it is still renowned as one of the most efficient fighter-killers of the Mayasuran Navy - an endearment despised by Mayasuran Aces.",,,
MSS_Argentavis,SHIP,"A heavily armed and armored destroyer, the Argentavis is the biggest in its weight class. With plenty of armor for a midline ship and a dangerous companion, the Argentavis serves as Mayasura's anvil. ",,,
MSS_Winghead,SHIP,"One of Mayasura's elite cruisers, the Winghead sports a quad array of medium ballistic mounts and an infernium jets booster for the engine block. After seeing the vulnerability of the Mokarran to heat-seeking missiles, Mayasuran engineers overdesigned subsequent classes of ships with rear-facing point defense. This trait combined with the rear mounted medium turret give the Winghead unmatched survivability in the field.",,,
MSS_Mako,SHIP,"One of the few heavy bomber designs in the Sector, the Mako is a frigate sized bomber with the shield and firepower to match. A built in autoloader gives the Mako punch with its centerline ballistic mount. ",,,
MSS_Arjuna,SHIP,"A ship made from Mayasurian decadence, the Arjuna is a heavy battlecarrier with strong armament and multiple decks. As a rival to the Legion-class, the Arjuna can hold its own in the line of battle. The greatest feature unique to the Arjuna is its superheavy turret, mounting a triple-linked gauss cannon. ",,,
MSS_Nebulosa,SHIP,"The Nebulosa-class is a prime example of heavy broadside firepower; with an extreme amount of guns equaling to a couple frigates, nothing can compare to the hail of bullets it exudes. ",,,
MSS_vigilance_m,SHIP,"In addition to their homebrew designs, Mayasura has made crucial upgrades to its regular midline ships. This Vigilance sports an additional rear small mount along with an upgraded engine.

An excellent harasser and support frigate, the Vigilance-class has oversized (for its class) energy and missile mounts. While it shines in a fleet setting, it can be easily overwhelmed by large numbers of smaller threats.",,,
MSS_bomb_frigate,WEAPON,A standard bomb bay modified with launch rails for assisted bomb launches.,Strike,,

MSS_Shuttlepod,SHIP,"Fast and lightly armed, the Combat Shuttle is a conversion of the standard crew transport pod that almost all ships carry. The humble shuttlecraft has been repurposed as a makeshift interceptor, armed with a machine gun and powerful engines. ",,,
MSS_Owstoni,SHIP,"Sporting heavy ion weaponry, the Owstoni is a dangerous companion to its bigger cousin, the Zygaena. Designed as a phase conversion of the Tiburo, this Superfighter is extremely agile and tough for its size.",,,
MSS_Sipahi,SHIP,"Mayasura's premier strike craft, the Sipahi Fighter-Bomber is light and nimble while carrying a moderate payload of EMP bombs. A turreted autolaser provides both defence against interception as well as additional pressure on the craft's target.",,,
,,,,,
MSS_inferniuminjector,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Arguably one of the most dangerous ways to boost one's spacecraft, infernium is injected directly into the engine's core. However, frequent use can lead to pilot nausea and a degradation of the ship's drive systems.",Movement,Provides an extremely fast boost to top speed.,
MSS_damper,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Activates an emergency energy field by redirecting power from the shield generator, this strengthens the armor for 5 seconds. Known as a 'Last Stand' ability, this can let a heavily battered ship bring victory from the jaws of defeat.",Defensive,Activates an energy field that diverts power from the shield generator.,
,,,,,
MSS_dronegunship,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Deploys the Akinci-class Drone Gunship. An extremely lethal companion to the teratorn, it serves as the Argentavis' fifth gun in battle.",Drones (midline),Deploys the Akinci-class drone armed with an assault chaingun.,
MSS_Akinci,SHIP,"The Akinci Gunship Drone is a powerful companion to the Teratorn it serves. With only three able to be fitted in the Argentavis' drone bay, replacements are limited until out of battle, where the miniature autofactory can slowly replace the gargantuan Akinci.",,,
MSS_bomb_KE,WEAPON,"The Kilij bomb bay is built directly into the Sipahi's underbelly. Carrying a modest payload of six electromagnetic pulse bombs, they're more than enough to disable any ship in one go.",Strike,,
MSS_Sagir,WEAPON,"The Sagir Autolaser is a homebrew fighter weapon made for the Sipahi's miniature turret. With a withering rate of fire, this gives the Sipahi its dual role as a Fighter-Bomber. ",Point Defense,,
MSS_Javanicus_A,SHIP,"This Javanicus is one of the older designs. A limited production run makes these rare to see.

The Javanicus is one of Mayasura's defensive battlecruisers. Sporting a heavy broadside and ballistic armament, the Javanicus can put astounding amounts of lead down the field at a moment's notice. With a highly advanced autofactory and refit bays located within the central deck, an extra large space is dedicated to the Perryi-class corvette.",,,
MSS_Perryi,SHIP,"Dedicated to being deployed only from stations, the Perryi-class is a mobile escort for Mayasura's system defense ships. Due to its size, one could fit it within a capital grade fighter bay, however no other ship can refit, manufacture and deploy the Perryi like the Javanicus.",,,
MSS_Hammerhead,SHIP,"A top of the line Hammerhead, the Mayasuran version of its prized destroyer features heavier armor and an additional turret in the rear for point defense.

A midline destroyer from the golden age of the Domain, the Hammerhead is respected for its staying power in battle as well as its ballistic capabilities.",,,
MSS_Ferox,SHIP,The Ferox is Mayasura's elite heavy bomber. Being fitted out with such a large and arcane weapon leaves the Ferox as one of the most expensive bombers in the Sector. ,,,
MSS_MiniPC,WEAPON,"This is a single shot version built into the Ferox-Class heavy bomber. Usually mounted on capital ships. Produces ruinous damage that cannot be withstood by most defenses - for long.

The plasma cannon is a large, arcane weapon which is difficult to manufacture and maintain. Those captains who can afford it are rewarded with one of the most devastating weapons platforms employed in the Sector.

Plasma cannons are related to graviton and phase beams, in that they use poorly-documented properties of brane physics to deliver their payloads. A plasma cannon shell is a microfusion bomb which uses gravitic and baryonic lens to focus its energy inward. The resulting explosion creates plasma which is contained by a temporary mini-universe anomaly, while magnetic drivers mounted on the forward pylons accelerate it toward the target. The containment field lasts only a couple seconds, which is usually long enough for the anomaly to reach a target. If the convex hull of the field is not breached by ordinary matter/energy delivering at least 9 kN, the higher brane will absorb the destructive plasma, and it will vanish from our dimension forever. ",Strike,,
MSS_Starliner2,SHIP,"In the process of militarising the Starliner, the Mayasuran Navy has not merely up-armoured and up-gunned the original frame. The majority of the accommodation decks have been replaced with additional reinforcement to withstand elevated combat stress levels, and much of the lower deck and pool apparatus has been removed to make room for the installation of the Orbital Howitzer. Every shot of this gargantuan weapon brings recoil that shakes the entire ship, often causing injuries to crew. All these changes result in a ship once desired for luxurious accommodation; now turned into a dangerous artillery vessel that brings crew comfort to the absolute minimum.

A passenger liner from a more civilized age, the Huan-Gogel 440 ""Starliner"" was built to travel between the systems of the Domain in speed and comfort. The Starliner features private first-class cabins, two classes of food service, a zero-G theatre, and even a small landing/launch bay for exclusive use by executive-class passengers. (Being a civilian ship there are, of course, no facilities for fighter repair and rearmament).

The Starliner is equipped with a forward shield to ensure passenger safety and protect the hull from routine abrasion. Refitted for the current realities of the Sector, this ship class is routinely equipped with all-band anti-missile flare launchers as well as a number of gun turrets; this serves not only to evoke a sense of adventure, but discourage casual piracy while justifying a ""munitions surcharge"" on each ticket sale.",,,
MSS_Starliner_Howitzer,WEAPON,"The Orbital Howitzer is an underslung beast of a cannon attached to the belly of the Starliner (M). Slow and unwieldy, only expert gunners have been able to use this gun for long range bombardment upon enemy ships.",,,
MSS_shuttlepod_4,SHIP_SYSTEM,Deploys several combat shuttles armed with light machine guns. The shuttles can be ordered to closely guard the ship or roam freely around it.,Drones (midline),Deploys several defensive combat shuttles armed with light machine guns.,
MSS_Joker,SHIP,"The Joker Artillery Drone is one of the heaviest drones available to Mayasura, its unique feature being the Joker module. The module works on a shuffled group of weapons, allowing for a randomized loadout each time. However, more devious captains could change their hand by recalling the Joker and sending it back into the fray. This technique would allow someone to use the entirety of their deck!",,,
MSS_jokerdrone,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Deploys the Joker-class Artillery Drone. Fitted out with the Joker module, this allows the Joker to have a randomized weapon each time.",Drone,,
MSS_Javanicus_B,SHIP,"The Javanicus is one of Mayasura's defensive battlecruisers. Sporting a heavy broadside and ballistic armament, the Javanicus can put astounding amounts of lead down the field at a moment's notice. With a highly-advanced autofactory and refit bays located within the central deck, an extra large space is dedicated to the Perryi-class corvette.",,,
MSS_Lasher,SHIP,"An ubiqutious design, the Lasher-class is a fan favorite of many Mayasuran captains. So much so that an upgraded LPC exists to keep it in line with Mayasura's other riff-raff of frigates. With an upgraded system combining the Lasher's natural accelerated ammo feeder with some added maneuevering jets, the Speed Shredder gives it both firepower and swiftness.

A favorite of pirates and private armies due to the ubiquity of the blueprints and its non-demanding support profile, Lasher-class frigates pack a respectable amount of ballistic firepower.

Lasher captains are usually no-nonsense types who let their weapons do the talking, and pick through the debris of enemy ships as opposed to trying more diplomatic or covert means of getting the job done. More often than not, that job involves quickly and effectively striking at (or guarding) small or medium-sized trade convoys. The light fighter and frigate escorts usually found guarding such convoys are hardly a match for the hail of projectiles a Lasher can quickly unleash. If that does not get the job done, the Lasher has another nasty surprise in wait - two missile hardpoints, more often than not fitted with ""finisher"" types of missile, such as the Harpoon MRM.",,,
MSS_overdrive,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Activates the Speed Shredder, boosting both speed and weapon refire rate on the current ship.",Offensive,Provides both speed and firerate.,
MSS_Sentinel,WEAPON,"A collection of smaller lasers mounted together on a rotating pod, with a built-in capacitor allowing extremely high burst damage vs fighters and missiles.

The Sentinel is a military grade PD system that is usually only deployed on capital ships due to its high production and flux costs. Can detect and destroy incoming strike weapons and enemy fighters that have penetrated the capital ship's defensive escort screen. 

A combination of an autonomous alpha AI core for targeting and eleven separate carbon dioxide lasers make this weapon exceptionally effective in point defense. A dedicated rotator power supply makes target tracking almost instantaneous. The prohibitive energy requirement usually means that the weapon is only activated for seconds at a time, but that is usually enough to deal with any PD threat.",Point Defense,,
MSS_big_arbalest,WEAPON,"A triple-linked assembly of Arbalest Autocannons, the cheap and simple Arbalest Battery allows a ship to pummel shielded targets with astounding reliability, and at a very low cost. The kinetic shells are especially effective versus enemy shields.

Heavier patrol craft at the time of the Collapse were mostly fitted with the Arbalest Mk I weapons platform; this likely explains why the Arbalest is claimed to be among the most scavenged ship weapon systems in the Sector. The primitive cooling system and a lack of an autoejector hamper rate of fire and reliability. 

The only redeeming feature is the ubiquity of blueprints for the arbalest round, which is effective at bringing down enemy shields. The effectiveness of the shells is poorly understood, and is suspected to lie in the unintended electromagnetic properties of the shell jackets.",Close Support,,
MSS_Sunder,SHIP,"An upgraded version, the Mayasuran Sunder is the envy of every faction. Featuring heavier armor and an improved generator, this highly lethal ship can fit even the heaviest of weapons like the Triple Beam Cannon.

A technologically advanced yet fragile destroyer from the late Domain era designed to provide additional firepower in fleet actions carried out by the stretched Domain Navy rather than serve on independent patrols. It has powerful shield emitters and energy weapons but is vulnerable to strike craft and flanking assault frigates.",,,
MSS_Stingray,SHIP,"Designed to replace the aging Kontos-class, the Stingray is a highly maneuverable carrier with a flurry of energy and missile mounts. With high speed and tons of firepower at its disposal, this fulfills the role of Mayasura's 2nd generation of destroyer carriers.",,,
MSS_Perryi_F,SHIP,"Dedicated to being deployed only from stations, the Perryi-class is a mobile escort for Mayasura's system defense ships. Due to its size, one could fit it within a capital grade fighter bay, however no other ship can refit, manufacture and deploy the Perryi like the Javanicus.

Due to the need for a small light attack ship, the Mayasurans designed the Perryi with strong armament, however due to its low capacity means being tethered to defense fleets. ",,,
MSS_tribeam,WEAPON,"An enormously powerful laser array, the Triple Beam Cannon combines three high-powered burst beams into a single mount. Boasting superior precision from the alternating emitters, it is especially effective at melting... Well, just about anything.",Assault,,
MSS_gorgon,WEAPON,"A rack of short range high yield guided missiles. Low cost combined with high damage make these a strong contender, however limited fuel gives it little endurance.

The Gorgon missile is a short range missile made for strike capabilities. Each rack has two easily suppliable missiles, making this an easy choice for low budget captains. With a devilish green glow hiding the potent charge inside the payload, this could be compared to torpedoes of the same caliber.",Strike,,
MSS_gorgon_single,WEAPON,"A single, short, high yield, guided missile. Low cost combined with high damage makes this a strong contender, however limited fuel gives it little endurance.

The Gorgon missile is a short range missile made for strike capabilities. With a devilish green glow hiding the potent charge inside the payload, this could be compared to torpedoes of the same caliber.

This mount features only a single missile.",Strike,,
MSS_Crossbow,SHIP,"A heavy bomber featuring twin Gorgon SRMs, the Crossbow could be compared to a fighter with its top notch thrusters, shielding and armor. Mounting Twin Sagir Autolasers, this gives the Crossbow a bite like no other, allowing it to size up even capital ships and do heavy damage!",,,

MSS_microburn,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Provides a brief engine boost, propelling the ship forward at an extreme velocity.",Movement,"Provides a brief engine boost, propelling the ship forward at an extreme velocity.",
MSS_rocketlauncher,WEAPON,"Fires a barrage of unguided rockets. Useful for dealing with enemy armor, or - due to having no flux cost - applying sustained pressure.

Features an upgraded high yield barrage of rockets. Rockets are unguided, with the extra space being taken up by a larger warhead and improved propulsion systems, as well as thicker armor. 

Performs well against larger targets due to the higher chance of striking with multiple rockets. A rocket attack is often used as a screen before a torpedo strike to reduce the effectiveness of Point Defense systems. ",Assault,,
MSS_Patriot,SHIP,"A great destroyer leader and highly balanced ship, the Patriot is an energy focused light cruiser with plentiful moblity. Designed to lead smaller Mayasuran destroyer groups, the Patriot can easily keep up with ships like the Hammerhead and Sunder while providing an anchor for the rest of the group to fall back upon.

Most of the firepower comes from the Patriots central turrets, with any weapon mounted being boosted by the powerful generator. That same generator is also responsible for giving the Patriot top notch shielding, making it able to hold the line of battle even in big fleet fights. Lastly, the generous turret arcs keep the ship safe from even the most deadly missile barrages and fighter groups.
",,,
MSS_Khopesh,SHIP,"The Mayasuran Khopesh is upgraded with bigger Obliterator rockets and another wingman to complete the trio. The Khopesh can deliver an accurate and devastating rocket barrage to its target. Safer and more reliable in dealing its damage than other bombers, it also doesn't boast quite the same damage potential.",,,

MSS_Pelican,SHIP,"The Mithuna is the last in the line of hybrid combat freighter and logistic boats. Although not as powerful as a regular battlecruiser, the Mithunas large modular guns provide the punch to hold off even the mightiest of pirate brigands under the fusilade of its firepower. Due to the high resolution sensors built-in to the front of the Mithuna, this ship is mostly used as the flagship for techmining convoys. With a huge hangar bay in the rear, the Mithuna is a fearsome opponent when provided with LPCs because of its ability to coordinate a targeting feed to its fighters.",,,

MSS_Didymoi,SHIP,"An average bomber design centered around its payload, the Didymoi comes equipped with two influence mines that can be launched around enemy shields.",,,
MSS_Gaffel,SHIP,"A design dating from before the Legion's conception, the Gaffel evolved from a prototype of a heavy, fighter-equipped combat cruiser. Highly uncommon in the Persean Sector, the Gaffel is immediately recognizeable as something of an enigma among low-tech carrier ships. It might appear menacing with its array of ballistic turrets, but the ship's flux grid would be underwhelming on a destroyer, and it rarely equips weaponry any more demanding than medium point defense systems. The Gaffel's real combat focus is on its fighters, and fielding four independent bays within its boxy hull, it can bring a devastating punch to a battle while staying well out of harm's way.

In early years of expansion into space, massive targeting computers could only be mounted on stationary stations. After unfortunate encounters with rebels shielding their station and gun batteries with megatons of asteroid dirt and dust, companies were contracted to deliver a carrier with significant strike capabilities and capable of self-defence. The Legion-class battlecarrier was in the works, but it was far from completion and a classified project at the time.

Knight Industries's prototype was the most promising and won the deal. Soon enough, Gaffel, at the time the heaviest carrier to be fielded and was put into production as a stopgap. Its many decks served well against any kind of space fortification and it was still able to scare away smaller ships. Its strike capabilities earned it the nickname of 'The Hive Queen', the carrier is notorious for dealing out hot, quick death to whichever target its captain deems worthy of receiving the payloads of its many underlings. Later on, The Legion was unveiled and Gaffel was dethroned, falling out of favor and slowly fading - which, however disadvantageous to KI, was still better than outright deprecation, which was the fate of many worse designs.

Technological advancement allowed the Gaffel to remove its unwieldy antenna array in the front, which was replaced by two missile hardpoints, giving it yet more bite. The Gaffel seen today has lost a lot of direct fire potential in its development, and in modern times its inefficient, overworked nanoforges demand constant maintenance - however, crafty engineers were able to jury-rig salvaged autofacs so that the Gaffel does not fall behind. The price, however, was one of the carrier's decks, as it was where the power plant required to keep newer models running was located. Despite this it still holds its own in a battle, relying on its low-tech armor plating for defence in close quarters. 
",,,
MSS_Manta,SHIP,"A highly mobile pursuit destroyer, the Mayasuran version is upgraded with advanced autofactories along with more efficient reactors. The standard burn drive has been replaced with a short duration infernium burn, providing an elite captain unparalleled mobility.

The overshadowed third wheel of the Hammerhead and Sunder rivalry, the slippery Manta is a midline destroyer that can leave most frigates eating its wake. The ship is comparable to its heavier cousins by its wide shield and middling logistical stats, but differs with its focus on lighter weaponry and a more powerful engine assembly. The Manta's gun mounts are undersized if versatile, but it has the ability to support a wing of fighter craft which amplify its combat potential tenfold. The fast destroyer is let down by relatively low integrity, and a tendency to outrun its own fighters when it activates its burn drive.",,,
MSS_Raseri,SHIP,"An early epoch battlecruiser design, the Raseri is known for its ghastly broadside firepower. A rare sight to be seen nowadays, many were lost fighting Mayasuran battlegroups due to the Raseri's lack of adequate point defense mounts. However, many will say that the Raseri can compete with even the strongest of Mayasuran battlecruisers like the Javanicus in a straight battle. Lastly, the Raseri has speed to chase down smaller targets with its supply of Nitro Burn canisters; for such a bulky ship to move fast is an amazing feat indeed.",,,

By allowing the Heavy Ion Lance to directly tap into its parent ship's reserves, it maintains a far more favorable energy and flux ratio.

mayasura,FACTION,"At one point in time, the Mayasura System was among the greatest polities of the Sector. It was once home to the Mayasurian terraforming cabal, an independent nation whose might rivaled the Hegemony, and acted as a roadblock in their expansion on the northern Core Worlds. Their capital of Mairaath was crowned with three massive space cities. Combined, they housed tens of millions of people and formed the keystone of the terraforming project which transformed Mairaath into a paradise world. Until the terrible day of October 22 of Cycle 82, when the Mayasurians were laid low.

A fanatical sect of the Luddic Path pledged itself to destroy this great false idol. They organized a decades-long operation of subtle infiltration and sabotage, and on the chosen day, the Path assaulted the three Astropoli that orbited Mairaath, culminating in one of them crashing into the planet and utterly devastating it. Shortly after the terrorist attack, a Hegemony task force led by Commodore Jensulte attacked the Mayasurian fleet and engaged its flagship, the Conquest-class MSS Garuda with the hope of destroying it in orbit over their dying world. Though the Hegemony was eventually repulsed, Mayasura's navy suffered extensive losses as they were dealt their second major blow right after the first.

While the survivors were offered membership in the Persean League that was formed shortly after in response to the debacle, Mayasura ultimately declined.

Mayasurian doctrine places the Loyalist in a similar position to the much larger Patriot, both often hosting the more eccentric commanders of their navy. 

Captains who pilot these vessels are known for being either irredeemable hotheads or cold, calculated strategists. Either way, the ability to actively drop component safeties and redline systems on a dime is highly valued by captains, and the extra strain on internals is considered a worthy sacrifice.

The lack of maneuverability compared its smaller brethren leaves it far more vulnerable to ambushes and flanks though, however with a flip of a switch the National is able to overdrive itself at a rapid cost to its deployment time. 

Early public documents list several iterations of a prototype which was developed as an artillery piece, but concerns about the hull being able to withstand constant use of all three turrets saw a complete gutting of the project.

After the Battle for Mairaath, the Admiralty decided to refit and upgrade many existing hulls in order to cover the largest shortcomings of their prior fleets. While the original Falcon is ideal for long-range gunlines and harassment, it falters due to its lack of missiles and vulnerability to being surrounded. By concentrating its firepower in the sides rather then the front and giving it the flux grid to keep up, shipwrights figured that it would make being outnumbered an almost tantalizing prospect.

MSS_MarkIXR,WEAPON,"The Mark IX Autocannon (Rotary) is brutally simple: a larger and deadlier version of its already bulky predecessor, designed for the modified Skysplitter's spinal mount. The hail of heavy slugs overwhelms shield generators and pummels hull, only losing effectiveness against heavily armoured targets.

With some of the Mayasuran Skysplitters modified to mount ballistic instead of energy weapons in their massive spinal mounts, the Navy requested a weapon for the mount to fill the anti-shield niche. The performance of the low-cost Arbalest Battery did not fulfil the project requirements; it was found to be lacking both range and stopping power, but the Mayasuran engineers that originally developed the Arbalest Battery managed to find inspiration from their previous project.

The Mark IX Rotary is a weapon in the same vein as the Arbalest Battery, a low-cost autocannon with an upsized mounting and more barrels to fire even more shells down range. The size of the Mark IX barrels and loading mechanism prevented a standard side-by-side mounting, so the engineers instead adapted the Avenger's rotary assembly to drive three heavy barrels. As a happy coincidence, the new rotary system provided an increased fire rate compared to a more traditional mounting.

The final version of the weapon is far too bulky to be fitted anywhere other than the Skysplitter's spinal mount, and the complexity of the mounting makes replacing it at anywhere other than a dockyard unfeasible. These shortcomings were both considered acceptable in the face of the Mark IX Rotary's shield-busting firepower.

MSS_TigerGL,WEAPON,"Developed as the anti-armor armament for the Skysplitter's ballistic configuration, the Tiger launches a flurry of proximity-fuzed charges from a spacious internal magazine, equally capable of swatting fighter wings and blasting through armor plate.

Unlike other weapons in the anti-armor role, the Tiger does not fire shells. It is instead loosely based on the sector-standard Proximity Charge Launcher and Mayasura's own Iruiru, firing grenades similar to the Proximity Charge Launcher but at greater velocity. The proximity fuzing allows it to augment the Skysplitter's unremarkable PD grid, freeing up its onboard small craft for other duties. Unfortunately, the size of the explosive charge had to be reduced to fit in the Tiger's barrel and achieve the greater muzzle velocity. 

The lower damage per charge is made up for by the large internal magazine. Combined with the simple loading system and lack of an ejection mechanism, the Tiger can launch a frightening amount of ordnance in a short amount of time. Its explosive charge is still sufficient to blast any unshielded fighter into smithereens, and the sheer number of grenades saturates PD grids and chews through even the thickest of armour plating.

MSS_Onbu_Railgun,WEAPON,"Named after a now-extinct creature much beloved by the Mayasurans, the Onbu Railgun does not fire shells like other weapons of its type. Instead, it fires massive bolts of diffuse plasma, with ruinous effects on unarmoured hull.

Born from the Skysplitter ballistic project, the Onbu was originally an upscaled version of the Caliburnus railgun around which the Excalibur cruiser is built. However, Mayasuran engineers quickly ran into a wall already encountered by the Domain: as the size of the slug to be fired grows ever larger, the mechanism required to fire it becomes ever more flux-inefficient. This phenomenon can already be observed in the Gauss Cannon, which uses magnetic coils instead of rails and so is actually more efficient than a similarly-sized railgun. But if a coil system were to be used instead of rails for the Onbu project, the complexity would be such that swapping weapons would be difficult even with a dockyard, significantly reducing the Skysplitter's flexibility.

However, Mayasuran ingenuity and resourcefulness prevails yet again. By drawing upon the ship's reactor, the Onbu shell is flashed into plasma, consuming a tremendous amount of energy. The rails then generate a magnetic field, launching the cloud of plasma towards its unfortunate target. The entire process is still not particularly efficient, and the relatively diffuse stream of plasma is less effective against shields and armour than a proper slug, but it is more than capable of scorching lightly armoured ships and disintegrating unarmoured hull.

Observers have noted the Onbu's similarity to a certain other weapon system, but Mayasura has so far been unwilling to divulge technological details. With the state of the Sector as a whole, it seems that nobody has the political will to pursue such an investigation... so far.",Sniper,,

The Gryphon is a dedicated missile cruiser designed to provide a highly mobile platform for heavy fire support. It is not a front-line cruiser, and so operates best when provided with escorts.

Among the so-called ""Cruiser School"" wave of ships designed by Altair Exotech, the Gryphon was a key component of the power-projection strategy that came into vogue shortly before the collapse of the Gate system. The Gryphon was meant to allow a task force commander to rapidly concentrate bursts of specialized heavy firepower, forming a devastating hammer to the anvil of assault-class cruisers and destroyers. So reads the Domain-era tactical manual, anyway.

Of particular interest is the Gryphon's hull-integrated missile nanoforge: this fixed architecture nanoforge system allows extremely rapid conversion of densely packed, pre-formulated feedstock into a narrow range of munitions in the midst of battle. This allows the Gryphon to effectively convert concentrated mass into desired armaments, allowing for mid-battle replenishment of missile stocks.
