-Changed Tiger Grenade Launcher reload count from 10 to 1 per second
-Added Harpoon MRM Array
Large missile mount Harpoon

Double the ammo count and no charge up should make it very reliable when switching from the Avenger to the Mark IX(R) 
-Changed Tiger Grenade Launcher to 0.16 refire rate, reload size to 20 for total reload time of 11 seconds
This should give you more sustainability at the cost of a longer but bigger reload.

-Removed National-Class Battlecruiser

They'll be back maybe?????
-Removed 6 small frontal mounts from the Excalibur, replaced it with a singular medium ballistic 360 mount at the rear
This should help immensely with the AI
-Changed Excalibur's medium missile mounts to composite
This will also help the Excalibur stay at range like it was meant to.

10.0.1 RC1
-No more shadow on Vishnu's Mark VII guns
-Added Victory M and Vishnu M to buildables for Mayasura.
This basically means you should  be able to build the Vishnu and Victory M successfully now
-Added in System swap to Victory (M)
So, I've added plasma jets, high energy focus and mine strike as variants of the Victory (M), each with their own unique paint job. I look forward to seeing your builds!


10.0.0 RC2
-Fixed Didymoi Minelayer
New missile behavior means it activates as soon as it gets in range rather than a timer. While unfortunate, I can't change this I think.
-Added pass through to the Mark VII projectiles, Caliburnus Railgun projectiles, Charged UV Pulse Cannon Projectiles.
These are all big projectiles with a lot of damage. So have fun sniping multiple fighters at once!
-Increased refire time of Mark VII to 12 seconds.
-Increased refire time of Armored Box Launcher to 12 seconds.
Both of these weapons will be keeping their massive alpha damage, however, you will have to be more deliberate with your shots.
-Increased the damage of the Orbital Howitzer from 1200 to 2000.
With how unwieldy this gun is, it deserves MORE damage.
 


10.0.0 RC1
-New Conquest Sprite
-New Heron Sprite
-Fixed Pyotr for 0.96a
-Added Pegasus (M)
-Added Crusader (M)

extreme woopsie, it's fixed now.

9.0.0 RC4

I forgot to add it in to the blueprint pile for mayasura 
-Added Rhea (M)
My first MODULAR armor ship
-Added Gryphon (M)
This Gryphon has +250 dissipation, +2000 flux capacity and +10 OP points in exchange for -0.2 shield efficiency.
Also the frontal missile mounts have been converted to synergy mounts, so have fun with that.
-Added Mule (M)
not in for real yet
-Added Charged UV Pulse Cannon
not in for real yet
-Added PORTRAITS
surprise lmao

9.0.0 RC3
-Fixed Armored Box Launcher being found as a droppable, sorry


9.0.0 RC2
-FIXED SKYSPLITTER (M) BUG FINALLY
Okay so if you get a D-modded Skysplitter, it will lack the swap hullmod for the system. However, if you restore the Skysplitter, you will gain access to the base Skysplitter hull and be able to swap systems again. I hope this fixes it for those that have problems!
-Adjusted volume for Mark VII cannons to 25%
I've noticed it was a bit loud! I have turned it down, haha.

9.0.0
-Added new Sprite for Tiger Grenade Launcher
-Added new weapons for Aznable Mech
These are gonna be the vulcan head and the triple beam cannon condensed into a pistol for the Aznable's arm
-Buffed Manta (M)
I've added a medium hybrid hardpoint to the front center of this thing. I've also changed the small energy hardpoints up front to be missile mounts. All of the small turrets have been turned into hybrid plus I've given this thing more OP, 95 from 75.
-Changed Nailer/Nailer (M)
I've  changed the Nailer to be a medium-light frigate like the Perryi with twin 'Nail' Cannons that are basically miniatuarized triple beam cannons. You'll find its ability to pursue its enemies with built-in firepower and especially if you install high scatter amplifier, it is a force to be reckoned with.
These changes represent myself wanting to see people use some of my under utilized ships.
-Added Vishnu-class Battleship
This is one of the largest capital ships I have ever made. It outscales all of my current ships and can serve as the ULTIMATE fleet anchor. However, it is slow and equipped with capital jets limiting your mobility. One thing to note is that the Vishnu has an Advanced Targeting Core, you'll be able to provide support from quite a distance.
-Changed back flag to old flag
people seem to like the old flag more it seems
-Switched Neutral theme to Friendly theme


8.3.9 RC2
-Renamed Mammoth in files to Onbu Railgun, this makes it so that when you select the Onbu Railgun in the hullmod thing, it shows you bright yellow texture
-Adjusted Onbu Railgun sound lower to half volume
might still be loud, haha
-Changed Spartan filename to MSS_Spartan.png and elite Version to MSS_Spartan_Elite.png
this should fix the linux version, I apologize!


8.3.9
-Added in weapon swapping to Skysplitter (M)
Base Weapon for the Skysplitter is the Avenger
Secondary Weapon is the Mark IX Rotary Autocannon, which is the Avenger but kinetic.
Tertiary Weapon is the Tiger Grenade Launcher which fires high explosive grenades that explode on proximity or max range. Use with ballistic configuration or ITU to maximize range and firepower.
Quaternary Weapon is the Onbu Railgun, which is a massive double barreled fragmentation railgun that shoots really fast and destroys hull on impact.

-Added in system swapping to Skysplitter (M)
Base Version of the Skysplitter is the SPEED CONFIGURATION, with Infernium Burn as its main system.
Version B of the Skysplitter is the ENERGY CONFIGURATION, which swaps out the system to High Energy Focus and swaps the medium mounts out for energy mounts. (Do note you'll have to click on and off of the ship for it to work in the refitting screen.
Version C of the Skysplitter is the OVERDRIVEN CONFIGURATION, which swaps out the system to Safeties Switch and gives it a COOL paintjob.
Version D of the Skysplitter is the BALLISTIC CONFIGURATION, which swaps out the system to Accelerated Ammo Feeder.

-Added in new fighter wing, Aznable.

8.3.8 RC3
-Changed Moa's large energy arcs from 185 to 210.
This should make the Moa more reliable in converging all of its weapons.
-Fixed Heavy Ion Lance builtins on the Scaramouche.
Now they should have the same damage as the modular version.
-Added Rhea-Class Superheavy Cruiser
This is the penultimate Mayasuran cruiser,  capable of huge broadsides typical of your average playstyle along with a sizable missile array.


8.3.8 RC2
-Changed rear large mounts of Victory (M) to composite.
*Someone* wanted semibreves.
-Fixed capitalization problem for the Spartan (M).
This should fix the linux problem.
-Updated dialogue for Pyotr

8.3.8
-Changed Avenger damage type from FRAGMENTATION TO ENERGY.
-Lowered Avenger damage from 250 to 200.
-Added ammo system to the Avenger.
This basically makes the Avenger feel like a bigger auto pulse laser. Use with expanded mags for full effect and 6.5 seconds of nonstop firing.

-Removed two medium missile mounts from Skysplitter (M)
-Added two decks to Skysplitter (M)
So this setup reflects the Mayasuran doctrine better with a focus on battlecarriers. Also, new sprite.

-Added Loyalist (M)
-Added Carnwennan (M)
-Added Spartan (M)
-Added Victory (M)

-Added in new Fleet Commander.

-Raised damage/sec of Heavy Ion Lance to 1000 (From 450)
This will let the Heavy Ion Lance compete with the Tachyon Lance in terms of soft flux damage for shields.

8.3.7
-Added Iapetus-Class Supertanker
Big thanks to WMGreywind and Yunru for finally giving me a logistics fuel tanker!
-Added Carnwennan-Class Railgun Frigate
-Added Spartan-Class Super Destroyerca
-Added Ballistic Rangefinder as a built-in to the Javanicus
-Returned Nebulosa (M) to its Railgun form
Haha, it just feels better to use than the Avenger. Sorry for taking so long!
-Removed Active time on Safeties Switch
So this means you can have it on FOREVER.
-Fixed Zygaena and Nightingale phase cloaks to normal vanilla phase cloak.
Temporary fix until I can figure out the custom visuals.
-Changed Avenger firerate from 0.18 to 0.1 refire time.
-Lowered Avenger range from 900 to 800
-Changed Avenger damage type from ENERGY to FRAGMENTATION.
-Lowered Plasma Bomb Launcher damage from 200 to 100.
This should lower the Mako (M)'s damage significantly; but still give plenty of damage to hurt bigger ships.


8.3.6
-Changed Gyrfalcon from midline BP to Mayasura_W BP
-Finally fixed PL Revanchist claim on Mairaath
-Buffed Mithuna cargo capacity from 550 to 1200
-Lowered Avenger's range to 900 from 1000
-Lowered Avenger's firerate to 0.18 refire from 0.15
-Lowered Caliburnus firerate to 5 seconds from 3.5
-Lowered Caliburnus range to 1300 from 1600

8.3.5 RC2
-Changed Skybreak's name to Skysplitter
-Changed Nebulosa (M)'s frontal large railgun to a deck, added Mega Ultraviolet Pulselaser.
This significant change in role will definitely change how you build the Nebulosa (M) along with giving it a very hefty gun and fighters to match.
-Changed Skysplitter's two front large mounts to the Avenger.
So, this change removes the modulars in exchange for the new gun, I hope you have fun with it!
-Added Invasion Mission that can be taken while under commission to take over the Lost Astropolis and Port Tse Station in the Mayasura system.
-Finally fixed relation bug in Nex, so you will be hostile to almost everyone and have allies with the persean league.


8.3.5 
-Returned the Mokarran's frontal composite medium hardpoint mounts
This how the Mokarran originally was like, it's fitting to be returned back to normal.
-Added Skybreak (M)
A Nia special, but you'll enjoy my rendition with its Infernium Burn!


8.3.4 RC3
-Updated Zygaena sprite
-Changed Starliner (M)'s ship system from shuttlepod escort to infernium burn
This is a huge buff, this now encourages a short range albeit extremely dangerous playstyle involving the Starliner (M). With assault chainguns blazing, you can now get in range of most ships and alpha strike them with the Orbital Howitzer.
-Removed Starliner (MMA), Nebula (MMA), Mudskipper (MMA)/Shuttlepods
Didn't really use them.

This is gonna break saves a bit, but if you're using the new Starsector version, I hope you've started a new save.

8.3.4 RC2
-Adjusted Gyrfalcon's arcs to be more AI friendly
So, I changed up the medium's arcs to be more restricted along with the frontal energy no longer directly facing forward; which should influence the AI to broadside 100% of the time rather than 50 or even 20% of the time.

8.3.4
-Added OFFICIAL music made by Hanawub
This is HUGE, now when you encounter Mayasura in hostile, neutral or friendly terms, you'll get an absolute banger. I hope you enjoy it!
-Fixed Graphicslib issues that made you CTD
-Fixed Excalibur (M) crashing by firing on unshielded ships.

8.3.3
-Added Iruiru Plasma Grenade Launcher
This is a very new concept for me, this is my answer for a medium energy HE weapon. If you've played a certain spartan game, you will be VERY familiar with how it works.
IT IS ALSO A SYNERGY WEAPON THANKS TO 0.95
-Added Gyrfalcon Medium Cruiser
This is what you've all been waiting for, my refit version of the falcon that does... broadsides.
-Added AI to Phase Gateway
So, this is a big gamechanger for the Arjuna (M), especially if you use it in your fleets. They now have the power to TELEPORT bombers on demand, which they could always do but not without an AI.
-Added National (M)
The National gets a hefty upgrade with its secondary energy turret being able to fire missiles now.
-Added Gyrfalcon (M)
In the SAME update, the Gyrfalcon is also getting an (M) version, with the same upgraded hybrid smalls just like the regular Elite Falcon.
-Added Scaramouche (M)
For those wanting an upgraded Interceptor, the Scaramouche upgrades its medium synergy to a large synergy, amazing for a late game fleet when you need a fast ship!
-Added Tiburo (M)
The Tiburo (M) has gone from a superfighter to a superfrigate, this upgrade gives it two small hybrids in the rear, negating weaknesses to salamanders by giving you more PD options.
-Added Excalibur (M)
You will be very interested in the Excalibur now with its AMMO switching system that can't be beat!
-Added Champion (M)
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
-Added Mako (M) Plasma MIRV bombs. 	
You've all waited for this, it's finally here.
-Buffed Sentinel PD System on Javanicus (M)
So, if you didn't think the Paladin was strong enough, I've added the frag AOE from the Paladin.
-Removed Graphicslib stuff
Very much deprecated.

8.3.2 RC2
-Blocked Ops center from being installed twice on the National/Loyalist
-Fixed center left turret on the Loyalist to be 150 arc and match existing arcs.
-Returned the frontal small missile slots to the Mokarran.
-Changed Loyalist's sprite a bit.
-Buffed Argentavis' armor to 800 (From 700)
This change is due to the Enforcer getting a defensive bonus and I plan on keeping up with such changes!
-Buffed Stingray Dissipation to 450 (From 350)
-Buffed Stingray Capacity to 5500 (From 4500)
-Buffed Stingray to 95 OP (From 85)
These changes will let the Stingray excel in a more combat focused role. With focus on its three energy mediums, more spicy loadouts can be made. 
-Added back in ammo system to UV pulse laser. It simply had way too good sustained DPS, this will curve it back a bit!

8.3.2
-Added National-Class Squadron Leader
This is my newest capital, capable of ruinous firepower with its three large energy turrets! You will find its firepower satisfactory for anything you mount on it!
-Added Loyalist-Class Command Frigate
This is my new frigate designed for those who like commanding from a frigate, using safety overrides and enjoying small weapons from a very... interesting chassis. 
It has increased PPT of almost 7 minutes, however its toggle safety overrides' system will drain that extremely quickly.
-Added Safeties Switch System!
Toggle your safety overrides with one simple button!
-Buffed Phase Gateway Range from 800 to 1600 units.
-Updated Cjuicy's portrait with a custom made one by Gwyvern!
-Added Reinforced Bulkheads to Scaramouche (CJ)

8.3.1 RC3
-Added Heavy Ultraviolet Pulselaser
This is my FIRST Rotary gun that I've made!
-Added Scaramouche (CJ)
This one honors Cjuicy, for asking me about an HVB! I simply fulfilled his request. It doesn't have a standard portrait for now, that is in the works.

8.3.1 RC2
-Buffed Javanicus armor to 1500 (From 1400)
This is a small incremental buff to the Javanicus' armor.
-Buffed Nebulosa DP to 35 (From 38)
The Nebulosa is meant to be the cheapest capital you can field and doesn't have the full complement of decks + weapons that my other capitals have.
-Buffed Excalibur's Deceleration to 25 (From 10)
This should make the Excalibur better in terms of AI. I would say this improves the efficiency by 1000%!
-Buffed Caliburnus Railgun's range to 1600 (From 1500)
This will also help the Excalibur's AI, since it likes to keep short range despite having a 1500 range gun.
-Changed Excalibur's Price to 90000 (From 100000)
-Changed Moa DP to 25 (From 22)
-Changed Moa Price to 140000 From (120000)
-Changed Sarissa DP to 22 (From 25)
-Changed Sarissa Price to 120000 (From 140000)
This change in price/DP should reflect their roles better. The Moa is quite the strong defensive cruiser in my line up, while the Sarissa should be equal to the Eagle's DP/Price range

8.3.1
-Added Shikra Escort Carrier
-Added Shikra (M)
-Switched out the Drover for the Shikra if you choose Carrier Small (2) in Nexerelin.
The Shikra is Mayasura's new two deck carrier, it will be replacing the Stingray in the two decker role. 
-Added Scaramouche Interdictor
The Scaramouche is a very fast destroyer with twin heavy ion lances.
-Added Starliner (M)
-Added Orbital Howitzer
The Starliner (M) is a heavy troop transport with a very dangerous chin cannon.
I've repurposed the Starliner Mk. II, so your saves won't break.

-Added Mokarran (K) High Value Bounty.
This one goes out to you, Kart!

-Changed Abandoned Astropolis description.
-Changed color of Onocrotalus projectiles/trail to green.
I will fluff this ingame as 'uranium' rounds!
-Stingray max flux to 4500 (From 3500)
-Made Shield Bubble Bigger
-Dissipation to 350 (From 240)
-Fighter Bays to 1 (From 2)
-Maintenance/DP to 11 (From 14)
-switched central missile to composite
-Added two smalls to the side.
-OP to 85 (From 90)
-Removed Combat/Carrier tags
The Stingray has now been changed to be more combat focused, with the addition of two smalls, its firepower has been significantly buffed with better flux handling and cheaper maintenance/DP for its new role.

8.3.0 RC2
-Javanicus PPT to 720 seconds (From 600)
-Javanicus Dissipation to 1300 (From 1200)
-These are the pre tournament stats that I'm putting back. Since the Javanicus should be Mayasura's last line of defense.
-Changed Mokarran's system back to Maneuvering Jets
These are the pre tournament stats
-Mokarran Shield Arc to 210 (From 270)
This should make the Mokarran more easily flanked, letting you use the PD weapons more.
-Mokarran OP to 300 (From 315)
Originally the Mokarran was at +130 OP, this should make it balanced at +115
-Changed Mokarran's frontal medium turrets to energy, frontal medium hardpoints to ballistics only, and the return of the large composite
This change will allow a greater variety of weapons to be used by the Mokarran.
-Removed two small energies next to the large turret, removed two small missiles.
In order for the large composite to come back to the Mokarran, other parts of the ship will have to be sacrificed.
-Sarissa OP to 145 (From 130)
-Sarissa (M) OP to 155 (From 145)
Originally the +30 OP was meant for a Heron, the +	45 from baseline is in between the Eagle and Heron, letting the Sarissa perform better.
-Fixed sunder's sprite floaters
-Moved Argentavis' central engine plume
-Removed Strike/Use vs frigates tag from the Gandiva
Hopefully this will fix some targeting issues
-Changed Patriot's default loadout to Ultraviolet Pulse Lasers
-Centered shield position for hammerhead/excalibur/sarissa
-moved stingray shield position
-Triple Beam Cannon turnrate to 10 (From 5)
This should help the TBC in firing continously on a target.
-Added Low Profile trait to Mayasura
This may make the Mayasura start *easier* but, hopefully Mayasura will not die during the first year. Still very possible with all its enemies!

8.3.0

In particular, the Winghead (M) has a fresh new coat of paint.

-Tiburo price to 15000 (From 25000)
-Tiburo DP/Maintenance to 5 (From 7)

This basically means it arcs faster, up to 5 arcs compared to the Tachyon Lance's 3.

-Added Arjuna (M)



8.2.9 RC6
-Nebulosa sprite changes
-Arjuna Flux Capacity to 14000 (From 18000)
-Arjuna Flux Dissipation to 900 (From 1000)
Did some testing, was a bit strong in over all flux. This should curtail the Arjuna, but still make it relatively good for its price/DP.
-Arjuna OP to 250 (From 260)
So, with the rearmost center medium turret removed, this left over an extra 10 OP; this should fix that.
-Changed Mokarran's system to Infernium Jets
Now, it has an effect of regular MJ, however it loses 25 of that speed in reverse.


8.29 RC5
-Buffed Gandiva DPS to 1050 (From 652)
-Changed to interruptible burst
This will allow you to shoot 1-2 shots by releasing your mouse button midburst.

-Changed Arjuna's Flux Dissipation to 1000 (From 800)
-Changed Arjuna's side turrets to mediums/removed center rear medium turret.

-Changed Arjuna Designation to Heavy Battlecarrier (From Siege Carrier)
-Mokarran Sprite Changes
-Arjuna Sprite Changes
-Gandiva Sprite Changes
-Excalibur Sprite Changes

8.2.9 RC4

-Raised Nebulosa's DP to 38 (From 36)
-Raised Javanicus' Price to 420000 (From 350k)
-Raised Mokarran's Price to 330000 (From 300k)
-Raised Mokarran's DP/maintenance to 45 (From 42)
This will match the Oddyssey in terms of pricing/DP

This is inbetween the Astral and Legion in terms of pricing.

-Raised Price of Sipahi to 8000 (From 7000)
-Raised Didymoi Price to 14000 (From 11000)
-Raised Khopesh (M) Price to 11000 (From 9000)

8.2.9 RC3
-Viper and Khopesh (M) easier to find in market now. (Previously unimplemented.)
-Adjusted Gorgon SRM damage to 900 (From 600)
This should buff the crossbow bomber to have a potential of 3600 damage now rather than 2400 HE damage.
-Switched Perryi (M)'s role from fighter to bomber on the Javanicus (M)
This will make it act like a bomber now.
-Added Governorship to Mayasura start.
