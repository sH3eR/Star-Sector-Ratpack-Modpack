sw_fusionbeam,WEAPON,"A deadly beam weapon capable of dealing huge amount of damage without any regards to power consumption or installation cost, ideal for ships with limited weapon slots.","- The trick is to look directly into it, bask in it's power and embrace it's absolution, only then you would be reborn! -High Ludd Tanus during the presentation.",,
sw_plasmastorm,WEAPON,"A terrifying weapon rarely seen anywhere, the PS-299x (Or Plasma Storm) swarms the battlefield with volatile heat seeking Plasma charges, each capable of changing target mid-flight, deals high damage but requires huge amount of energy to fire.","- The Sky burns, and sinners with it.",,
sw_phalanx,WEAPON,"The Phalanx launches a pair of Supercharged Particles that deals massive areal damage on impact, the sheer power of this weapon can easily overload most targets and destroy all fighters and missiles around them.","- Its been a week since we submitted our hazard report, the director seems uninterested in safety protocols but maybe that was the goal from the start ?",,
sw_tartarus,WEAPON,"Advancements in EM-missile design enables the Tartarus to surpass its predecessor with improved damage and tracking range, contact with targets delivers more potent EMP blasts allowing this weapon to disable most capital ships from long distances.","- Old solutions becoming obsolete ? just make them bigger, stronger and more dangerous, that should solve the problem! -Overheard from a Diktat meeting.",,
sw_photonlense,WEAPON,"This unique weapon concentrates light into dense matter and launches it at high speed, impact destabilizes the target reducing its resistance to kinetic damage, particularly effective against shields.","- In the depths of eternal darkness, a shred of light ignites new opportunities, it will shape us into something worthy! -The book of Ludd, Visions 5:1.",,
sw_terror,WEAPON,"This battery launches 8 unguided terror torpedoes in quick succession ripping apart unshielded targets in no-time, overwhelms most PD weapons, optimal for mid range encounters.","- Brute force problems require brute force solutions. -Overheard in a Hegemony weapon Lab",,
sw_railgun,WEAPON,"An unconventional weapon that accelerates energy into supersonic stream via electromagnetic circuits, the stream will bypass everything until it reaches maximum distance, highly effective against larger ships.","- The body can be bound and shackled, but the spirit will persevere in the end, unless you break it along the way. -The book of Ludd, Absolution 3:5.",,
sw_prismdriver,WEAPON,"A high pressure burst laser capable of dealing massive damage to a group of enemies, it's devastating impact results in an energy discharge that damages additional targets based on proximity.","- By splitting the high pressure ray into multiple refracting instances we can make good use of it's energy to cause more harm, the properties of light never ceases to amaze me! -Leaked Tri-Tachyon research recording, lab entry no.153",,
sw_reflective_shield,WEAPON,"This Unique module takes up a heavy slot in exchange of modifying the ship shields allowing them to Reflect most incoming projectiles, while incapable of inflicting any real damage on it's own, the WM-70 scales it's effectivness based on the offensive capabilities of hostile ships.","- Stop hitting yourself.",,
sw_positronlens,WEAPON,"The Positron lens is a modified version of the Photon driver created by the Syndicate, it sacrifices some of its support capabilities in exchange of improved damage output, the impact Ionizes the target causing it to take increased damage from most sources.","- QnkgaW52ZXJ0aW5nIGVuZXJneSBhbmQgaW5zdWxhdGluZyBBbnRpLW1hdHRlciB3ZSBjYW4gYWNoaWV2ZSByZXZlcnNlZCBlZmZlY3Qgd2l0aCBtb3JlIHBvdGVudCByZXN1bHRzIQ== -Encrypted Syndicate entry.",,
sw_blackhole,WEAPON,"The GR-890 concentrates dense Antimatter into pure energy that destabilizes spacetime, after few seconds of uninterrupted firing the target area Implodes creating a miniature Black Hole that rapidly damages all nearby objects within a wide area around itself, Weapon requires lots of time and energy to fire.","- Stare into the abyss, and the abyss may stare back into your soul.",,
sw_bfg,WEAPON,"A terrifying Radioactive weapon that crushes all in it's path, while slow, the Protonium charge can damage targets far away from it's location making this weapon ideal against both larger ships and swarm of smaller crafts, requires lots of energy to fire.","- Which one of you thought that it would a good idea to launch all of our Protonium reserve at the enemy ?? you deserve a raise! -Diktat fleet commander 'Riza Alex' to his subordinate.",,
sw_lightspear,WEAPON,"This weapon fires an Ionized Plasma charge that shatters violently on hit, resulting splinters ravages everything in their path and can damage multiple targets in a straight line.","- The trick is to let the enemy believe that it's finally over, Just then the shrapnels comes knocking on their door. -Overheared in a Tri-Tachyon Lab",,
sw_hyperpulse,WEAPON,"Rapid firing pulse emitter designed to repel attackers at medium ranges, it offers high damage, good range and great accuracy allowing it to excel in any combat scenario.","- Sometimes you just need some bloody damn good equipments to get the job done. -Tri-Tachyon CEO Sunny",,
sw_flash,WEAPON,"This powerful anti-matter Accelerator launches a piercing Tachyon-charge that ravages everything in its path, the charge is highly effective against all types of defense and it's damage grows greater the further it travels.","- QWx0aG91Z2ggYSBmcmllbmRseSBzaGlwIGJsb2NraW5nIHRoZSB3YXkgbWlnaHQgZGlzc3VhZGUgeW91IGZyb20gZmlyaW5nIHRoZSB3ZWFwb24sIGhhdmUgZmFpdGggdGhhdCB0aGUgZW5lbXkgYXQgdGhlIGVuZCBvZiB0aGUgc3BlY3RydW0gaXMgZ29pbmcgdG8gdGFrZSBtb3JlIGRhbWFnZS4= -Encrypted Syndicate entry",,
sw_novax,WEAPON,"An advanced defensive system that launches miniaturized heat seeking missiles capable of destroying the heaviest of rockets and fighters with ease, acts as a makeshift anti-ship weapon when necessary.","- Sometimes in-order to solve a missile issue you just need to throw more missiles at it, a lot more missiles. -Overheard at Lions Guard HQ",,
sw_gauss,WEAPON,"This long range weapon fires highly pressurized slugs that build up Kinetic energy as they travel further, damage scales with distances to targets allowing this weapon to outperform it's counterparts at maximum range at the cost of close quarters efficiency.","- You see that ship ? don't let it get close, otherwise we won't yield sufficient results for our superiors, and you know what that means. -Hegemony weapon scientist to the commander of the fleet.",,
