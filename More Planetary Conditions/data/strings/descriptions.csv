niko_MPC_defenseSatellite,CUSTOM,"A domain-era derelict anti-asteroid satellite, presumably placed in orbit to defend against stellar debris from falling onto the planet below.",,,
niko_MPC_defenseSatelliteBarrage,TERRAIN,"An array of defense satellites constantly watch over this area, showering anything they deem a threat with a hail of long-ranged artillery.",,,
niko_MPC_defenseSatelliteCore,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

When exploratorium drones discover a planet, they often perform rudimentary terraforming to better increase it's chances of becoming a viable planet for the ever-growing domain. One such terraform is to prevent any space debris from falling down to earth, and these satellites are one such way of doing it. Armed to the teeth with anti-asteroid, anti-scrap, and, some may argue, anti-ship weaponry, these quite intimidating orbital bastions dominate the orbit of whatever planet they orbit, preventing any unidentified and unauthorized matter from erronously entering their sphere of influence. 

Between those that were aware of the existance of these satellite prior to the collapse, there was often a hushed whisper and quiet idea that these satellites were built for more than just point-defense duty, rationalizing this obvious nonsense - at least, that's what domain ComSec portrayed it as - with the unusual amount of heavy weaponry and layered armor for something of it's nature.
Between those that are aware of their existance now - There is a very common agreement that these things are terribly annoying, intimidating, and lucrative to control.",,,
