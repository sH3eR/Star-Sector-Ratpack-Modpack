Domain-Era Anti-Asteroid Satellites,niko_MPC_antiAsteroidSatellites_derelict,TRUE,FALSE,data.scripts.campaign.econ.conditions.defenseSatellite.niko_MPC_derelictAntiAsteroidSatellites,"$market has its orbit dominated by an array of hundreds of thousands of domain-era exploratorium anti-asteroid satellites, presumably placed by survey drones in an attempt to increase terraforming viability. Each one is outfitted with enough weaponry to annihilate a small asteroid field, and enough armor to sustain the impact of their scattered debris. Coincidentally, these characteristics also make them excellent at destroying pre-collapse scavengers and rebels-those whom fleets composed of converted civilian ships with weak shields, unreliable targeting computers, and plentiful missiles. Their effectiveness in the current day is also quite impressive, given how few of these planets are ever explored.",graphics/icons/markets/niko_MPC_antiAsteroidSatellites.png,10
