First, the message is intended as a bounty posting. The target: one Admiral John, dread pirate lord and commander of the fabled Flying Dutchman, a legendary Galleon-class treasure ship rebuilt into a formidable pirate dreadnought and weapon of war.

Second, the communique was originally sent by one of John's own lieutenants, herself a pirate of some reknown who spent several decades at his side aboard the Dutchman. Her insane rantings suggest that perhaps the legends of a curse placed upon the ship are to be taken seriously, if not literally - she describes ghostly hauntings and apparitions in florid language, but the actual happenings she describes broadly line up with more credible descriptions of symptoms experienced by crewmen who have held long-term posts aboard phase ships or in close defensive positions around makeshift hyperwave relays.
