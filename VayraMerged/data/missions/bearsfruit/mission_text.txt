Life's tough for a deep space miner, even a successful one. Especially when you stumble across a maximum-security secret military facility, or... whatever the hell this is. It's not like you had time to ask questions - they're spooling up their reactors to combat power now, and you've already got missile lock warnings flashing on your display. Giving a heavy sigh, you direct your crew to battle stations. 

It's not much, but it's honest work.
