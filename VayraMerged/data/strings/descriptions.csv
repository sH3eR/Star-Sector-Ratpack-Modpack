communist_clouds,FACTION,"A rag-tag alliance of ideologically diverse - some would say 'incoherent' - rebels and guerillas, the Persean Democratic People's Revolutionary Council traces its origins back to armed affinity groups formed for community self-defense during the Askonian Crisis on Umbra. No longer content to be lumped in with the pirates and brigands who now primarily populate their homeworld, they have begun looking out to the fringes of the sector for new territory to claim and bring their dreams of a better society to light.

Although generally poorly armed and equipped, rumors have begun to spread in recent cycles that the Revolutionary Council may now be accepting shipments of arms and other materiel from an unknown benefactor or benefactors among the more powerful factions of the sector. Whether or not they can band together with enough cohesion to form an effective ally for these shadowy backers remains, of course, to be seen.",,,
warhawk_republic,FACTION,"The Stormhawk Republic was declared seemingly overnight, its founding fathers - largely children of displaced Mayasurians and bitter veterans of the ongoing conflict with the Hegemony - casting off what they saw as the shackles of diplomacy binding the Persean League and setting out to, in their own words, ""take the fight to the enemy"". 

Intelligence reports on their actions seem to confirm that their current goal is the establishment of military shipyards and industrial centers across the fringes of the sector in order to support the ongoing war effort. ",,,
almighty_dollar,FACTION,"The Rimward Venture Trading Company is a recently formed mercantile/colonial conglomerate, counting among its board members representatives from the Ko Combine, Eridani-Utopia Corporation, and even Hegemony civil authorities. According to recent hyperwave press releases, their corporate mandate is to expand profits by establishing new fringe-sector sites for tech-mining, resource extraction, and luxury development.",,,
science_fuckers,FACTION,"The Independent AI Research Mandate is a loose organization of scientists dedicated to the research, exploration, and cataloguing of the remains left across the sector by the chaos of the First AI War. The initiative was founded by one Alexander Campbell, a well known former Tri-Tachyon corporate officer who resigned and liquidated his assets to fund this endeavour. Despite public disavowal from Campbell’s peers and statements from corporate spokespeople claiming no association with the Mandate, suspicions remain that they are secretly still working alongside their former colleagues to further the ambitions of Tri-Tachyon as a whole.

As such, many powerful players in the galactic game have eyes on this company. For now it does as its charter claims, sifting through ruins of the war and sealing away dangerous technologies that could awaken a new conflict.",,,
ashen_keepers,FACTION,"The Ashen Keepers are a society - some would say a cult - formed around the figure of a Luddic tech-heretic who famously preached a rejection of the technophobia and romantic idyllicism of the Church while still evangelising the faith of Ludd and decrying the excesses of Domain-era AI and transhumanist projects. Besides those factions who make heavy use of the aforementioned Molochs, the bulk of their ire is directed towards the Luddic Path, whom they see as utterly unforgivable fanatics bent on perverting the path of Ludd away from redemption to annihilation.

Despite being declared apostate and excommunicated by the church, every day more of the disillusioned faithful flock to the Ashen Keepers for a chance at better, easier lives then the endless harvest and toil in the fields and factories of Gilead. The Keepers are a dim hope for those who yearn to be free, and a bitter curse on the lips of the church elders.",,,
vayra_manifesto,SHIP,"Pride of the Revolutionary Council Armada, the Manifesto is a robust light battlecarrier. Armed with a versatile - if somewhat light - weapons package and equipped with advanced ammunition forging and delivery mechanisms to temporarily boost its firepower, the Manifesto excels at delivering heavy ballistic and strike craft support wherever it is needed in the battlespace.",,,
vayra_galleon,SHIP,"A gigantic and extremely well-defended merchant vessel, acting as a mobile command center, financial institution, tax collector, bazaar, and corporate luxury liner for executives of the Rimward Venture Trading Company. Constructed to collect extracted wealth from outlying colonies in the furthest most dangerous reaches of the sector and return it safely home to the Company's shareholders, the Galleon's nigh-impregnable armored belts and heavy weaponry are proof against scavengers, pirates, and more powerful threats alike.

While its cargo of regular freight and trade goods approaches the capacity of an entire merchant fleet in and of itself, the most valuable items carried by the Galleon are the hardcopy credit stores and financial documents necessary for the operation of the Rimward Venture. No few enterprising pirate captains have met their deaths at the end of its potent broadsides, lured by the promise of wealth enough to instantly catapult any who would succeed in taking the Galleon to the status of pirate legend and one of the richest individuals in the sector.",,,
vayra_pegasus,SHIP,"A technologically advanced heavy escort fighter design armed with tactical beam weapons and autoloading support missiles. While range and sturdy shield generator cause it to excel in a close support role, relative cost and long refit times along with a lack of dedicated PD weaponry mean the Pegasus can sometimes struggle when swarmed by lighter, more agile strike craft.",,,
vayra_workhorse,SHIP,"An agile light fighter with surprising bite, deployed en masse as an escort screen for armed freighters plying dangerous trade routes. Relatively heavy armor for an interceptor gives it staying power in a fight - and pilot survivability - far in excess of the more common Talon.",,,
vayra_galleonflares,SHIP_SYSTEM,Launches flares that distract the guidance systems of incoming missiles and PD weapons. Any missile hitting a flare will be destroyed.,Defensive,Launches flares to confuse the guidance systems of nearby enemy missiles.,
vayra_boltonmissiletubes,SHIP_SYSTEM,Remote-fires a prefabricated Swarmer SRM from each fighter launched by the carrier.,Offensive,Remote-fires a prefabricated Swarmer SRM from each fighter launched by the carrier.,
vayra_yak,SHIP,"A light interceptor deployed by the PDPRC from escort carriers, converted freighters, or even jury-rigged shuttle bays. Armed only with a Kashtan scattergun, the Yak lacks staying power in a fight but can still pose a threat to other strike craft.",,,
vayra_blackshark,SHIP,"Stemming from a different heritage than the streamlined aerospace fighters favored by most factions, the Black Shark's design ancestors were heavy rotary-wing attack craft employed in persistent, close-range support of ground assaults. Armed with short-range assault rockets and protected by thick armor, it moves sluggishly for an attack craft but can stand in extended combat with enemy warships.",,,
vayra_pugachev,SHIP,"The Pugachev is a supermaneuverable heavy interceptor, specialized in chasing down fleeing enemies and disabling targets of opportunity with its ionized plasma beam - also effective against light armor. Extremely dangerous in swarms.",,,
vayra_molotov,SHIP,"The Molotov is an extremely atypical bomber, carrying large missile pods stocked with low-payload missiles rather than one or two heavier pieces of ordnance. The Vampir ASMs it deploys have a specialized payload, dealing additional damage to enemy capital ships relative to their performance against smaller targets.",,,
vayra_kashtan,WEAPON,"A light scattergun firing specialized continuous-rod antifighter ammunition. Short-ranged and ineffective against shields or heavy plating, but devastating to strike craft armor.",,,
vayra_plasmalance_fighter,WEAPON,"A potent beam weapon, propelling an ionized jet of superheated plasma at relativistic speeds. The jet has a short duration and effective range, but has good armor penetration and carries enough force to temporarily overpower the thrusters of missiles and other small targets.",,,
vayra_lightrocket_fighter,WEAPON,"Smaller cousin to the ubiquitous Annihilator, Extinguisher rockets carry much less payload and fuel but are simple enough to be replicated onboard light strike craft by an integrated autoforge. Effective against frigate and destroyer armor, but struggles against heavier plating.",,,
vayra_incendiarysrm_fighter,WEAPON,"The Vampir ASM is a curious design, carrying a relatively light payload but delivering a potent concussive blast on impact that resonates through capital-scale targets, causing them to literally shake themselves apart.",,,
vayra_tpc,WEAPON,"A post-Collapse refinement of the bulky Thermal Pulse Cannon ordinarily seen built into the side pinions of the Onslaught-class battleship. While still much too large to be fitted to a modular energy emplacement, careful engineering has allowed the mounting of these formidable weapons in specialized turrets powered by colossal pulse generators buried deep in the Galleon's hull. As the broadsides of the Galleon-class treasure ship, they pose an overwhelmingly powerful defense against any that would try to steal its riches.",Heavy Assault,,
vayra_necrocore,RESOURCE,"This alpha-level AI core is unique, slightly larger than others you have interacted with and noticeably - almost preternaturally - cold to the touch. It resists all standard testing, refuses to communicate through any channel, and in its presence you can't help but feel a distinct sense of... unease.

An alpha-level AI core is capable of excelling at any task. Assigning one to run a colony-wide industry brings benefits well beyond the capacity of human leadership, and there are even rumors of alpha cores surreptitiously assigned to govern entire worlds.

Selling AI cores on the open market is prohibited by most factions. However, higher-up faction representatives are often willing to exchange AI cores for large sums of cash when communicated with directly, though their reasons for doing so may vary.

The alpha-level AI core is the physical soul of a fearsome alien intelligence. An alpha can create art which perfectly simulates human pathos, plausibly debate any philosophical position, and form what appear to be deep and meaningful bonds with human beings. Alphas have been known to perform elaborate 'jokes' built over years which can only be appreciated due to the intention that a particular human subject become cognitive of the whole at a specific time and context.

Although the locus of vast material and intellectual investment, alphas terrified Domain strategic planners. Like all AI, each alpha was watched, controlled, and ruthlessly eliminated at the first sign of disloyalty. The Hegemony carries on these policies with even greater fervor.",,,
vayra_colossus4_rg,SHIP,"The Colossus was first adapted for war by Pather militants, but enterprising pirates soon followed their lead. This particular specimen, however, seems to have been rebuilt even further from the original specifications than the common pirate conversion. No doubt inspired by the common Atlas Mk.II battlecruiser conversion, the weapons systems of this Colossus have been comprehensively overhauled and fitted with both an advanced targeting unit and overclocked autoloading mechanisms. Beneath the bright coat of Red Guards livery, it has been stripped down and rebuilt for maximum durability at minimal cost. Elaborate sensor arrays and failure-prone high-tech communication consoles have been pared away, leaving only those systems absolutely necessary to the vessel's function as a mercilessly efficient weapon of war.

The Colossus heavy freighter formed the core of Domain frontier supply fleets before it was outmatched by the brutal economic efficiency of the Atlas superfreighter. Thicker than strictly necessary hull plating provides protection against cosmic hazards both natural and human.",,,
vayra_listening_post,CUSTOM,"Deployed to collect information, extend comm networks, or simply mark territory, listening posts are in common use across the sector. Due to the cheapness of their construction - little more than a few automated systems and a databank - they are often left in place when their services are no longer needed.",,,
vayra_abandoned_station,CUSTOM,"A massive orbital platform, scarred by radiation and fully powered-down with the exception of a few faintly winking emergency lights.",,"Dull red emergency lights illuminate the shattered docking ring. The corridor into the station is riddled with holes, evidence of light weapons fire. There are no signs of life.",
vayra_hammerhead_warhawk,SHIP,"A product of the Stormhawk Republic, this Hammerhead-class destroyer has been engineered with universal weapon mounts and an integrated flight deck to increase its tactical flexibility.

A midline destroyer from the golden age of the Domain, the Hammerhead is respected for its staying power in battle as well as its ballistic capabilities.",,,
vayra_broadsword_warhawk,SHIP,"The Stormhawk Republic has recoded this Broadsword LPC to better fit their fighter-focused fleet doctrine, upgrading the reactor to midline-standard levels of output to allow for increased speed and longer time-on-target.

Tough and agile, the Broadsword carries a decoy flare launcher that draws defensive fire away from high-value targets like bombers and their payloads. However, it can falter if faced with the need to deal the killing blow itself.",,,
vayra_thunder_warhawk,SHIP,"The Stormhawk Republic has recoded this Thunder LPC to better fit their fighter-focused fleet doctrine, adding the ability for it to launch decoy flares.

Extremely fast, well-armed, and with a long engagement range, the Thunder's strength lies in enabling a carrier to rapidly project force at the desired location. Not as damaging as a bomber or as tough as a heavy fighter, it will falter if forced into a prolonged engagement.",,,
vayra_khopesh_warhawk,SHIP,"The Stormhawk Republic has recoded this Khopesh LPC to better fit their fighter-focused fleet doctrine, upgrading the reactor to midline-standard levels of output which allow it to keep up with wings of heavy fighters in rapid assaults.

The Khopesh can deliver an accurate and devastating rocket barrage to its target. Safer and more reliable in dealing its damage than other bombers, it also doesn't boast quite the same damage potential.",,,
,,,,,,
antediluvian_azores,SHIP,"The Azores is, even among the ancient ships of the Antediluvian Armada, something of a relic. Originally designed as a prototype for the ionized gas engines of the first Atlantean spacefarers, it has since gained a fearsome reputation as a light attack craft despite its aging flux core design and lack of a shield emitter.",,,
antediluvian_forlorn,SHIP,"The Forlorn-class is a sleek heavy frigate fitted for combat and exploration, capable of operations both in liquid and aether. Equipped with superior ballistic weapons and an exeperimental phase-slip aether submersion system, it excels at hit-and-run tactics against larger enemies.",,,
antediluvian_pressure_gun,WEAPON,"A pair of high pressure rifled barrels, fitted upon a rotating base. Special hydraulics allow for this turret to expel slugs of metal at incredible velocity regardless of exterior pressure, making the pressure gun ideal for underwater and extra-planetary duty.",Point Defense,,
antediluvian_torpedo_launcher,WEAPON,"A high pressure launcher, capable of propelling titanium-shelled high explosive torpedoes at high initial velocity both underwater and in space. The torpedoes carry a small reservoir of ionized gas propellant, allowing them an extended range albeit at a much lower cruising speed once their initial launch velocity is lost to liquid/aether friction.",Strike,,
antediluvian_solon_blaster,WEAPON,"Using a modified drum-chamber to create intense gravitic vibrations, the Solon Blaster is capable of producing ripples in the very fabric of space. These ripples are propelled forward in a directed pulse, shattering matter in their path. The flux requirements of the device, unfortunately, are just as formidable as the damage it can cause.",Assault,,
antediluvian_reflector,WEAPON,"A beam weapon that can cover large distances and is effective in both water and space, the Reflector is the Antediluvian Empire's answer to phase-capable or shielded targets. High-energy particles are passed through a series of nano-reflective pools within the chassis before refraction through a gravitic prism, causing catastrophic overload to shield systems hit by the weapon.",Close Support,,
antediluvia_submerge,SHIP_SYSTEM,"A prototype phase-class ship system, charging the surrounding aether with phase energies and submerging the ship to leave it suspended between dimensions and impervious to attack. Due to not fully entering p-space, power consumption is higher and time dilation less significant than with typical phase cloaks. However, the detrimental effect on the crew's psyche is also considerably lessened.",Defensive,"Submerges the ship in phase-charged aether, rendering it impervious to attacks.",
vayra_battleaxe,SHIP,"The Battleaxe borders on corvette- or light frigate-sized, but lacks its own integrated travel drive and must rely on carrier or tender vessels for transport and deployment. Armed with a diverse array of weaponry, the Battleaxe is commonly seen in an escort role protecting Hegemony trade convoys and light strike detachments.",,,
vayra_groundhog,SHIP,"A heavy utility frigate originally designed for high-risk resource extraction in dense asteroid fields and planetary debris, the Groundhog has surprising mobility for its mass thanks to a wide network of maneuvering thrusters. Heavily armored and boasting a military-grade flux core design, it is frequently lauded by independent mining captains as an excellent light freighter and salvage ship - one that poses at least as much of a deterrent to pirates as any escorts that might be deployed alongside it.",,,
vayra_tyrant,SHIP,"The Tyrant-class fast battleship is considered by some to be ahead of its time, having been developed in the late Mastery epoch - long before the Domain's later adoption of fast capital designs such as the Conquest- and Odyssey-class battlecruisers. Although generally scorned by naval commanders of the era in favor of the much more heavily armed and armored Onslaught, the aptly named 'Tyrant' was put to use in a number of engagements against anti-Domain rebel groups on the galactic fringe and developed a reputation as a fearsome - if still infrequently deployed - combatant.",,,
vayra_oppressor,SHIP,"Occupying a comfortable place on the spectrum between ponderous, menacing heavy cruisers, sturdy carriers, and more agile but less well-defended lighter craft, the Oppressor is most commonly seen deployed in system defense fleets where its relative mobility, omnidirectional shield emitter, and ample light weapon arrays allow it to provide point defense cover and fighter support to Dominator-class line assault and artillery ships.

Having been supplanted by the Eagle as the Armada's primary line cruiser, many examples of the class were relegated by the Domain to second-line units and defense forces in galactic backwaters such as the Persean Sector. Thanks to the Hegemony's revival of early-Domain ""Decisive Battle"" fleet doctrine, Oppressor-class cruisers can once again be found on the stellar battlefield; where their fighter squadrons and massed banks of weaponry prove just as formidable against pirates and corporate raiders as they once did against anti-Domain rebels.",,,
vayra_subjugator,SHIP,"Equipped with primarily light weaponry besides a Thermal Pulse Lance built into the bow of the hull, the Subjugator-class fast cruiser devotes a disproportional amount of displacement to engine capacity. With mobility well in excess of some contemporary destroyers, it excels in a role as a hunter and killer of lighter craft or aggressive assault ship against stations and larger vessels.",,,
vayra_persecutor,SHIP,"An uncompromisingly effective combat vessel, the Persecutor is agile enough to catch and kill slower frigates and other destroyers - and poses a credible threat to larger vessels as well, thanks to specialized ammunition loading systems which allow it to achieve unparalleled weight of fire for its class. 

Many overconfident cruiser officers have met their deaths at the wrong end of the Persecutor's devastating ballistic firepower. Pirate and corporate-backed raider captains across the sector have gone so far to nickname it the 'Angel of Death' in reference to its distinctive flying-wing silhouette, and some veteran destroyer and frigate captains will go so far as to refuse to engage Persecutors without overwhelming support - a behaviour that they often credit for their survival to veterancy.",,,
vayra_intimidator,SHIP,"In the bloody cycles since the collapse, the Intimidator-class destroyer has found favor with both Hegemony junior command officers, who appreciate its access to strike craft support; and Logisticarum bureaucrats, who appreciate its ease of repair and maintenance thanks to an abundance of parts shared with the Enforcer-class combat destroyer which it is often deployed alongside.

Originally designed to provide fire support and interceptor cover in light combat flotillas, the Intimidator had the misfortune of being sent for its first major production run just before the ""Cruiser School"" fleet doctrine became popular in Domain naval procurement committees. Quietly pulled from production and brushed under the rug in favor of more specialized and dedicated light carrier designs, Intimidator hulls were sequestered in vast orbital hangars by the hundreds and shipped off to ""reinforce"" system defense units in fringe provinces such as the Persean Sector.",,,
vayra_bruiser,SHIP,"Once typically deployed in support of port authority and system defense patrols, the Bruiser-class frigate was nonetheless eventually replaced in Domain-era naval doctrine by the archetypical Brawler with the advance of so-called ""Core Epoch"" ship designs. Despite being decommissioned in every fleet the Domain of Man deemed of importance, numerous examples of the class survived in backwaters such as the Persean Sector - where their heavy armament, armor, and ease of maintenance have won them a certain degree of respect unlikely to fade with the introduction of newer and less-proven designs.",,,
vayra_hatchetman,SHIP,"A tried-and-true design for a fast and aggressive gun cutter, the Hatchetman was eventually phased out of the Domain's naval stock with the introduction of the Wolf. Despite a power core design which frankly bordered on obsolete even during the epoch of its production, the Hatchetman combines mobility with more than enough firepower to pose a threat on the battlefield - especially when approaching on a well-timed micro-burn aimed directly at its opponents engines.",,,
vayra_swordsman,SHIP,"A potent attack frigate designed around a suite of powerful engines and versatile weapon mounts. A sturdy shield generator leaves the Swordsman more than capable of taking some punishment in the line of battle, despite its relatively light armor.

With the phasing out of the venerable Lasher at the beginning of the Core Era, the Domain found itself faced with an unforeseen gap in its fleet doctrine: While heavily armed Brawlers and Hammerheads excelled at delivering ballistic kill power in small-to-medium fleet engagements, it lacked a speedy fast attack craft for deployment at the combat patrol level. The Swordsman, originally a testbed for prototype modular energy weaponry, was quickly militarized and put into production to fill this opening.",,,
vayra_huntress,SHIP,"A fast, aggressive light destroyer, bristling with thruster outlets and weapon mounts. While not capable of mounting heavy anti-ship weapons, the Huntress excels in its role as a fleet picket and light outrider; chasing down and forcing engagements with smaller ships, against which it can take advantage of its superior shields and flux handling to emerge victorious.",,,
vayra_tac_drone,SHIP,"Athame-class support pods are frequently deployed as supplementary defense craft for rear-line carriers. Small, lacking a shield emitter, and essentially unarmored, they rely on their long-ranged weaponry and the point defense gunners of their escort targets for protection. With time-to-live in a hostile battlespace measured in single-digit seconds, assignment to one is widely regarded by fighter pilots in the sector as a death sentence.",,,
vayra_battlement,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

The Battlement is a hulking behemoth of a drone cruiser, mating thick bulkheads and heavy armor to a centrally located forge vat capable of supplying its primary missile batteries with ammunition more or less indefinitely. Somewhat alarmingly, records preserved from the Domain indicate that the missile autoforge technology used by the Battlement significantly postdates the departure of the initial Explorarium sporeships and motherships bound for the Persean Sector.",,,
vayra_motte,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

The cruiser-scale Motte-class carrier drone was designed to operate in concert with the Bailey-class drone fighter, capable of being deployed en masse to escort Explorarium motherships in passage through rebel-controlled fringe sectors or dense asteroid fields. Armed with a respectable battery of light strike or blasting missiles as well as radial point defense guns, it also saw some use on the fringes as a support vessel in engagements against anti-Domain rebels with significant fighter presence.",,,
vayra_bailey,SHIP,"Autonomous AI heavy fighter for use by Domain automated warships. Commonly deployed by Motte-class automated carriers, the Bailey is a tough - if somewhat sluggish - strike craft that relies on a decoy flare launcher as well as its thick hull and armor to give it excellent loiter time in engagements.",,,
vayra_castellum,SHIP,"Autonomous AI rocket bomber for use by Domain automated warships. Commonly deployed by Motte-class automated carriers, the Castellum is a slow but dependable drone bomber carrying a single rack of Annihilator explosive rockets.",,,
vayra_ditch,SHIP,"Autonomous AI interceptor for use by Domain automated warships. Commonly deployed by Motte-class automated carriers, the Ditch is an agile interceptor drone equipped with a pair of vulcan cannons and a single-launch decoy flare system.",,,
vayra_fortress,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

A rare example of a Domain-era drone equipped with modular energy hardpoints, Fortress-class automated cruisers seem to serve the dual purpose of resource extraction and heavy fire support. Capable of stripping an asteroid or comet to its component molecules in a matter of minutes, the Fortress's fearsome array of directed energy weaponry serves just as well against harder targets such as cruisers and capital ships. Incorporating technology centuries more advanced than most Explorarium drones, the Fortress must have been designed relatively late in the Domain's history. How it came to be carried in the Mothership's memory banks... Remains unclear.",,,
vayra_redoubt,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

The destroyer-scale Palisade drone is a fast and aggressive automated warship, constrasting starkly with other Explorarium drones as a vessel clearly designed for war. Curiously, according to the scattered histories that have survived the Collapse, the Palisade was first deployed in combat against anti-Domain rebels several decades after the Explorarium Mothership destined for the Persean Sector departed on its journey.",,,
vayra_tower,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'.

The heavily armed Tower-class drone is a standby of Explorarium automated task forces, constructed and deployed as needed when the Mothership accumulates enough evidence to suggest that it faces a 'heightened' threat level. Carrying a medium ballistic weapon backed up by several light hardpoints and an overcharged autoloader system, it is capable of posing a threat to dedicated warships - at least on the lighter end of the scale.",,,
vayra_tarsus_ii,SHIP,"Segments of armor plating from a damaged or destroyed Conquest-class battlecruiser have been grafted around the hull of this Tarsus-class freigher, turning the formerly unassuming civilian hull into a formidable ship of the line in its own right. While an upgraded flux core has been fitted to power the additional weapon mounts, compromises in power allocation result in a notably underpowered shield generator.

Tarsus-class ships are well known as perhaps the most flexible and durable freighters in the Sector. 

The secret to their reliability is that they were intended by Domain designers as hazard duty ships, presumably to supply frontiers and those front line fleets send to quash the ever-present rumbling of insurrection on the far reaches of the Domain.

Almost unmatched among civilian ships in bulkhead structural density and armor rating, Tarsus-class freighters are entrusted with important hauls and usually travel in convoys, a further buttress to the safety they afford to their crew and cargo.

Minimal weapon mounts permit the ship to mount a nominal PD weapons package. Rarely, Tarsus-class ships are outfitted with combat oriented hull or armor boosting modifications, which make them more difficult to maintain.",,,
vayra_lr_mining_drone,SHIP,"The particular model of Mining Pod produced by this LPC has been equipped with a modified high-intensity burst mining laser, a light launcher for marker flares, and a longer-ranged control transmitter - at the cost of some tactical computing overhead lowering the number of concurrently deployable drones.

Sturdy and uncrewed, the Mining Pod can provide a bit of a distraction and a bit of fire support, and not much else.",,,
vayra_heavy_drone_tender,SHIP,"A hulking deep-space mining vessel, the Badger-class heavy drone tender's capacious cargo holds and launch bay have lent it a reputation as an excellent choice for independent companies looking to expand their inventory. Sturdy armor and versatile weapon mounts - for a utility ship, at least - have made it a favorite of captains who roam far from civilized space.",,,
vayra_prospector,SHIP,"Originally designed for long-haul exploratory and prospecting missions, the Prospector is an agile light utility destroyer with capacious holds and fuel tanks. Equipped with an integrated Ionized Plasma Projector and a pair of hardcoded drone nanoforges, this ship is a favorite of independent captains who operate beyond the fringes of civilized space thanks to its ability to hold off light pirate and corporate raider threats without reliance on escorts - though its lack of military-grade subsystems begins to tell in longer engagements.",,,
vayra_pioneer,SHIP,"Affectionally referred to by its captains and crew as a 'brick', the Pioneer is a cruiser-scale salvage and utility vessel with a long pedigree of success in galactic backwaters such as the Persean sector. Tough armor and remarkably versatile main battery hardpoints have seen it frequently pressed into service by planetary defense forces and mercenary flotillas in the tumultuous cycles since the Collapse.",,,
vayra_pathfinder,SHIP,"Relic of a lost age, the Pathfinder was designed for the use of multisector mining, exploration, and resource extraction conglomerates - titans of industry with interests spanning the full extent of Domain space. Now cut off from their former owners in the relative backwater of the Persean sector, these hardened vessels have found particular favor among the prospectors and scavengers who make their living picking through the Domain's leavings out on the fringe... at least those who are successful, or lucky, enough to acquire one.",,,
vayra_bear,SHIP,"More akin to a mobile station than a ship, the Bear-class superheavy mining platform was originally designed for planetary-scale resource extraction. Bristling with auxiliary mining lasers and carrying a small fleet of attendant drones within its cavernous holds, the Bear is capable of processing a comet or large asteroid into its component materials within a matter of minutes. In the chaos of the post-Collapse Persean Sector, these spaceborne behemoths have also seen service as mobile fire support bases and exploration motherships - at least among those outfits and companies that can afford to fuel and maintain one.",,,
vayra_survey_drone,SHIP,"This light survey pod is equipped with a relatively long-range control transmitter and a light marker flare originally intended for flagging mineral deposits. In the tumultuous cycles following the Collapse, many independent mining/exploratory concerns in the sector have taken advantage of the drone frame's high energy output to refit them with rudimentary ion pulse weaponry.",,,
vayra_mining_platform,SHIP,"Bulky and well-armored against impacts from stray space debris, the unmanned Mining Platform proves just as durable in the face of sentient detritus such as pirates.",,,
vayra_hammer_carrier,SHIP,"These unmanned drone pods mount a single Hammer-class blasting charge, originally intended for asteroid and lunar mining. Slow, unshielded and relatively fragile, they have nevertheless seen frequent use as light strike bombers in the cycles following the collapse. ",,,
vayra_wolverine,SHIP,"A robust drone frigate, carrying a heavy mining blaster along with a veritable arsenal of smaller lasers, and mounting a set of burst-operated maneuvering thrusters allowing it to greatly increase its agility when needed. The Wolverine was designed to support the Bear-class heavy platform in - relatively speaking - delicate operations such as ship- and station-breaking, where the massive bulk and nonmaneuverability of its mothership would cause difficulties.",,,
vayra_mining_hound,SHIP,"This hound has been extensively modified for deep-space mining. Changes include replacement of its weapon hardpoints with energy-capable mounts for blasters or plasma cutters, and the installation of a hardwired light mining laser in the portside engine nacelle. The onboard power plant has been overhauled to support these additions, at the cost of some armor and speed.

An old but durable hull class that lacks a shield generator, this frigate is sometimes used to ferry cargo instead of for combat duty. A lucky or gifted officer could make his fortune given the chance to captain one.",,,
vayra_hail,SHIP,"An exceedingly agile vessel, the Hail-class light pinnace is a recent development by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. While the ship is poorly armed, its causality-violating 'Temporal Shell' system enables it to punch well above its weight.",,,
vayra_direwolf,SHIP,"An agile, technologically advanced destroyer with an oversized weapon mount, an efficient shield generator, and an overtaxed power core - in every way, this is a Wolf-class frigate writ large.",,,
vayra_razorback,SHIP,"A fearsome hand-built gunship, cobbled together from almost-functional scraps of many different vessels and plated over with heavy armor for good measure. The Razorback boasts a salvaged destroyer-grade power core and versatile mounting options allowing it to be refit for a variety of combat roles, although its efficacy in any of them is somewhat handicapped by its sluggish engines and lack of a shield emitter.",,,
vayra_henchman,SHIP,"The Henchman-class is an atmosphere-capable heavy destroyer-sized combat dropship, designed to deploy and support more than a company's worth of marines during planetside operations such as tech raids. Compared to the more common Valkyrie, it sacrifices some agility and troop capacity in exchange for heavier armor and radial weapon mounts useful for ground support.

Enterprising fleet commanders have been known to lean into the Henchman's capabilities by outfitting its radial mounts with anti-ship weapons and installing a jury-rigged fighter nanoforge in the shuttle bay, converting the dropship into a light carrier with the ability to protect itself both on-mission and in space combat.",,,
vayra_greyhound,SHIP,"A common modification package among independent and pirate militias thanks to its simplicity, the Greyhound has been refit for combat rather than light shipping. An auxiliary powerplant has been installed in place of the shielded cargo hold, and light weapon mounts fitted to the engine nacelles along with a system to temporarily overclock ballistic autoloaders for additional firepower.

An old but durable hull class that lacks a shield generator, this frigate is sometimes used to ferry cargo instead of for combat duty. A lucky or gifted officer could make his fortune given the chance to captain one.",,,
vayra_typhon,SHIP,"The Typhon-class cruiser bristles with energy weapon emplacements, backed up by a high-powered flux core more than capable of sustaining their fire for extended periods. Lacking the mobility or forward missile-focused loadout of its cousin the Aurora, the Typhon instead relies on its efficient shield, deep flux reserves, and wide turret arcs for protection. 

A transitional vessel produced by the Tri-Tachyon corporation to placate old-guard Domain Navy procurement officers seeking a return to the 'glory' of line-cruisers such as the Eagle and Dominator, the Typhon is a product of the same school of warship design that produced the Paragon-class battleship.",,,
vayra_badger_p,SHIP,"A pirate-built derived class, based on the Badger heavy mining drone tender. The additions include applique armor welded over the front bulkheads, a large central drive unit, and a heavy spinal gun mount. Due to the lack of supporting upgrades to the vessel's flux handling infrastructure, viable outfitting options are - fortunately for freighter pilots across the sector - somewhat limited.

A hulking deep-space mining vessel, the Badger-class heavy drone tender's capacious cargo holds and launch bay have lent it a reputation as an excellent choice for independent companies looking to expand their inventory. Sturdy armor and versatile weapon mounts - for a utility ship, at least - have made it a favorite of captains who roam far from civilized space.",,,
vayra_defense_pod_p,SHIP,"Fragile, short-ranged, and barely armed - ultimately, the only good things that can be said about the pirate-built Defense Pod are that at least it is cheap and uncrewed.",,,

vayra_blood_dog,SHIP,"An extremely overbuilt and excessively modified Hound, developed well beyond its initial specifications at the hands of its captain, the notorious Gal Paladin. Along with the obvious improvements to its weapons loadout and flux core, it boasts a transplanted military-grade shield generator and a surprisingly advanced C3 suite.",,,
vayra_warlord,SHIP,"The Warlord began its life as a Conquest-class Battlecruiser, possibly one of those originally brought to the sector by the illustrious XIV Battlegroup which founded the Hegemony. However, over the two-hundred-odd intervening cycles it has been repaired and rebuilt so many thimes that very little of the original hull still remains. Its capabilities differ significantly from its parent class, having been completely refit according to Hegemony standard ""Decisive Battle"" doctrine with an improved shield generator, near-impregnable armored belts, and massive Hammer-class torpedo broadsides fed from capacious internal magazines.",,,
vayra_kingfisher,SHIP,"A quick little shuttle with military-grade engines, an efficient shield, relatively heavy armament for its size, and a non-demanding support profile. The Kingfisher is a favorite vessel of not-quite-legitimate businessmen, tramp freighter captains, and other pilots whose work takes them frequently into - and beyond - the many combat zones and contested areas of the sector.",,,
vayra_spade,SHIP,"The Spade is a light hauler and mining launch that, despite an extremely competitive pricing scheme and generally nondemanding support profile, never managed to achieve the same success and ubiquity of its competitors - namely the Hermes, Kite, Pegasus, and eventually the Mercury. The Spade's sole redeeming feature is that with generous machining tolerances and so little internal volume devoted to crew, fuel, or cargo space, customization of the hull and weapon mounts is surprisingly easy. Often criticized for its weak engines, unshielded and essentially unarmored hull, and barely present hardpoint layout, it nonetheless remains in service in the Persean Sector... Most often in the hands of short-haul asteroid miners, in-system smugglers, and extremely down-on-their-luck scavengers or tramp freighter captains. 

Despite being originally manufactured before even the aging Hound, the Spade has been reclassified as a part of the Midline school of ship design due to the style of its engine pods, actually a semi-recent modernization.",,,
vayra_ruin,SHIP,"A prototype heavy defensive frigate, equipped with a low-power phase teleporter system allowing it to remotely deploy light Stinger-class fragmentation mines. Accusations that the vessel's integrated point defense system exceeds the Domain-era restrictions on sub-Gamma-level AI remain - so far - unproven.",,,

Light on point defense but carrying a posse of heavily shielded defensive drones, the Exemplar represents what may have been a shift in Domain naval doctrine near the time of the Collapse.",,,
vayra_seer,SHIP,"The Seer is a prototype dedicated support carrier, an attempt to miniaturize potent Recall Device technology for mass deployment on smaller vessels. Lacking in auxiliary weapon mounts, it is typically outfitted with a long-range beam weapon for fire support and must rely heavily on escorts for protection.",,,
vayra_clairvoyant,SHIP,"Recently designed by the Tri-Tachyon corporation in an attempt to close the ""carrier gap"" existing between their forces and other sector navies in the sub-capital range, the Clairvoyant is something of a technological marvel. Blending hyper-advanced flux handling systems and powerful shields with a pair of military-grade fighter nanoforges, the Clairvoyant's only shortcomings are slightly under-spec engine performance and a lack of weapon mounts if not fit with flux-intensive blaster weapons.",,,
vayra_caliban,SHIP,"The Caliban is an advanced asymmetrical heavy fighter design, carrying decoy flares along with a diverse collection of weapons and effective against most targets. Powerful shields give it good staying power in a fight, especially when deployed alongside other shielded fighters to spread damage and give each other time to vent flux.",,,
vayra_hammer_carrier_p_launcher,WEAPON,"This pirate-designed LPC hack forms the standard Hammer-class blasting charge directly into the carrier drone's frame, offering it rudimentary guidance and additional protection on its way to the target - at the cost of speed and, of course, destroying the carrier drone on impact.

Due to their inherent fragility, crystal projectiles are fired at a relatively low velocity and are very vulnerable to point defense.",Close Support,,
vayra_splintermirv,WEAPON,"A heavy carrier missile, launching a wide spread of razor-sharp charged crystal shards which lodge in targets and resonate with others to form powerful secondary explosions.",Strike,,
vayra_srm_4,WEAPON,"A simple guided missile pod featuring a rapid autoloader system, powerful engines, and advanced tracking capabilites, although individual explosive-tipped warheads deal only light damage and are susceptible to point defense. ",Assault,,
vayra_strikecannon,WEAPON,"A short-ranged double barrel mass driver, launching a heavy fission-reactive warhead which detonates in a sub-kiloton nuclear explosion to produce excellent damage against hard targets as well as a knock-on EMP effect. While both chambered shells can be fired in quick succession upon initial engagement, the weapon's aging autoloader design restricts it to a much slower sustained firing rhythm.",Strike,,
vayra_superheavy_driver,WEAPON,"Derived from the massive spinal cannon of the lost Behemoth-class battlecruiser MPC, the depleted infernium slugs fired by the Jannah siege driver are forged in microgravity orbital environments and equal the size of some strike craft. While its potential destructive energy is immense, the capacitor recharge and physical reload time of the weapon are severely restricting.",Artillery,,
vayra_vlrms_large,WEAPON,"An aging, large-framed missile design which affords plenty of room for propellant, targeting systems, and explosive payload at the cost of combat thrust - at least until it nears its target and discards its bulky long-range tanks for a closing sprint. The kill vehicle fires a series of unguided submunitions upon final approach, allowing it to bypass some forms of point defense. This emplacement features six launch tubes, fed by an autoloader for continued support in long engagements.",Fire Support,,
vayra_vlrms_med,WEAPON,"An aging, large-framed missile design which affords plenty of room for propellant, targeting systems, and explosive payload at the cost of combat thrust - at least until it nears its target and discards its bulky long-range tanks for a closing sprint. The kill vehicle fires a series of unguided submunitions upon final approach, allowing it to bypass some forms of point defense. This emplacement features three launch tubes, fed by an autoloader for continued support in long engagements.",Fire Support,,
vayra_volley_gun,WEAPON,"Fires small-caliber kinetic penetrator darts, serving as an effective close-in weapon against shielded or unarmored targets. Built-in targeting system is incapable of recognizing missile-sized sensor signatures unless upgraded or overridden.",Assault,,
vayra_vsrm_fighter,WEAPON,"A short-range guided missile with a light fragmentation warhead and an excellent propellant/guidance package, employed by Kadur fighter pilots to decoy point defenses of warships or deliver the killing blow in a dogfight. An integrated autoloader system keeps fighters in the field without requiring refit.",Assault,,
vayra_microimpulsor,WEAPON,"A short-ranged beam cannon with an integrated point defense targeting system, blasting apart incoming missiles and enemy fightercraft with an oscillating pulse of directed force. The beam is sufficient to overpower the thrusters of light vessels, stopping them in place or causing them to spin out of control.",Assault,,
vayra_ioncycler,WEAPON,"A miniaturized blaster weapon, firing pulses of ionized plasma that wreak havoc on lightly armored vessels and electrical systems alike. A powerful bank of capacitors allows it to sustain an extremely high fire rate, at least for short periods of time.",Assault,,
vayra_antimatterpulse,WEAPON,"A fiendishly complicated electromagnetic assault cannon, firing accelerated positron bundles from internally powered mag-containment shells. The positron bundles are quickly annihilated by contact with aether, giving the projectiles a short effective range and a bright 'trail' as they fly.",Assault,,
vayra_hammer_barrage_forever,WEAPON,"This dumb-fire rocket was ubiquitous in the Sector pre-Collapse due to civilian applications discovered by asteroid miners. The go-to strike weapon of the desperately under-equipped, the Hammer is most often employed by poor independent militias, Pirates, and especially the Luddic Path. This has led to the mildly blasphemous alternative name for the weapon, ""Ludd's Hammer"".

The Hammer Fusillade mount provides a stirring example of the expediency of quantity, and is connected to a weapons-grade autoforge for sustained fire.",All-Purpose,,
