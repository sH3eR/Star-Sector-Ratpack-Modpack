- Updated the XP tracker hullmod icon using an asset provided by Serenitis in 2022
- Added LunaLib support (note: not every setting is in LunaLib, those that aren't still read from the json)
- Added setting to condense XP gain text
- Changed Global.getCombatEngine() to CombatEngine.getInstance(), which creates the combat engine if it doesn't exist.
  Should fix those rare strange cases where Global.getCombatEngine() is mysteriously null.
