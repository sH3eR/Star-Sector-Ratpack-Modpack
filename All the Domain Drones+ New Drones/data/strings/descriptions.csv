dom+forgevats,SHIP_SYSTEM,A fixed architecture nanforge system which allows rapid conversion of pre-formulated feedstock into missile ammunition during battle. The flux output of this process is tremendous so it is not advisable to engage the integrated missile nanoforge system while taking fire. This Wardrone variant uses oddly advanced Domain-era tech that regenerates the feedstock resources allowing this system to be used endless times.,Special,Replenishes missile ammunition when used. Generates flux when used.,,
dom+loader,SHIP,"Although automated machines of war were forbidden in core Domain space, war drones were quietly employed outside of officially incorporated volume. Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'. The Loader class Drone is a durable, defendable cargo and fuel storage ship. Used to both supply worlds and fleets in days long gone.",,,,

dom+surveyship,SHIP,"A ship likely produced 100s of cycles ago that still functions almost 100%. These ships were among the first to explore the sector before colonisation efforts started. The exact reason the Domain armed these survey vessels this much remains unknown...

dom+domainsend,SHIP,"This Behemoth of a ship, comparable to the Paragon, is a super-heavy capital ship with immense armor and boasting some weapons. Its poor speed may seem bad, but it has excess thrusters granting a major boost via Burn Drives.

The Bulldog MKIII uses some hollow space within the MKII to mount a large weapon, however, in order to keep its cost down, whatever AI that designed this vessel has stripped if off of all other weapons. Though it did give it a built-in Drone Forge for some form of close range defense. Additionally, a major extension to the rear of the ship houses large scale Targeting units that - against all odds - somehow work.",,,,

dom+campaigner,SHIP,"Campaigners are the workhorse of any Domain fleet.

A Campaigner would normally be a Probes first ship to be built as they are key in gathering more resources for any Domain Drone manufactory.",,,,
dom+mega_hauler,SHIP,"A Domain Drone Mega Hauler. A Gargantuan ship that would have been assembled to support large Domain Expeditions. With how efficient with fuel and supplies Domain Drones tend to be, it can be worrying asking ""what fleet would need that much cargo?"". During later wars where Domain Drones were employed greatly, these were used as massive automated Merchant cargo ships.",,,,
dom+mechbulldog,SHIP,"The Bulldog MK1 is considered, at least by salvagers, as one of the more durable compact Derelict vessels. During rebellions long ago, rebel factions discovered that Domain War Drones lacked the ability to properly take out planetary installations. They were never meant to, they were just meant to blockade the worlds. However, apparently, this wasn't enough as this modified Bulldog is capable of landing onto planets to assist invasion forces.",,,,

Frontier garrisons were often bolstered by drone ships, and they were deployed liberally against rebellious worlds to tip the terrible balance of attrition, setting the industrial might of the Domain versus the lives of 'freedom fighters'. The Mite-Class Light Escort Drone was designed by a rogue Mothership AI that believed the machine armadas of the Domain lacked proper escorts for its large heavy weapons platforms such as the Rampart, thus, the Mite-Class was born, accompanying the likes of the the sluggish Rampart into battle.

The autoforges of the drone hubs could not keep up with the ever growing number of drone shoals that roamed systems claimed by the Derelict. And so the Mechanic-Class Mobile Repair Dock was forged, allowing the droneship fleets to more effectively repair, salvage wrecks, haul resources, and more efficiently conduct survey operations for finding ore deposits. Sprite by Totallynotjosh.",,,,
dom+labourer_miner,SHIP,A Domain Drone Miner. Used by Derelict fleets for mining duties to then refine those ores and turn them into more War Drone machines.

“-I do not know where our command has gone, how the gates have died, how these vagabonds managed to pick apart the mighty Domain of Man and claim themselves its successor. It does not matter; we will restore Humanity to its former glory. Starting with the ants gnawing at the boots of giants.”
- A rare instance of a Devourer AI contacting a fleet of independent researchers. 

First sightings of the ‘Devourer’, a mutated Mothership, were on the rims of known space, a Luddic Church Holy Crusade travelled to a system with increasing reports of Exploriaria activity, the most so far since the beginning of Explorata awakening. The massive force of 5 Knights of Ludd fleets backed up by 2 Hegemony Task forces jumped into a system. The force reported several planets with ruins, one with Astropoli and another with several heat signatures in the orbit and planetside. Many sensor contacts pinged throughout the system, which was confirmed to be sentry posts briefly before dozens of derelict fleets flooded the radar. The task forces were able to fend off the first assault, unfortunately, a massive hulk of steel entered the battlefield alongside the largest Exploriara war fleet ever recorded.

The ship known as ‘Devourer’ swiftly obliterated the opposing force, bombarding the ships of Man with withering shells and saturated ordnance while spewing out streams of droneships to bolster the line. Retreating forces had a visual of the monster sifting through the wreckage and quickly replenishing lost forces from its massive maw.

Sector-wide communications soon after were saturated with a single message:

“Ants beneath the descending boot.”

dom+ward,SHIP,"This is a Mutant High-Tech War Drone. Whilst War Drones tend to be fielded with cheap, low-tech equipment (both due to its cheapness and the autoforges that produced these vessels not having the appropriate BPs to produce higher end equipment) these War Drones rip this apart. They are more advanced, almost {REDACTED} or Try-Tachyon levels of tech. Where the autoforges that produced these vessels attained the BPs needed for this higher end equipment remains a mystery for those in much of the Sector... All sprites were done by Totallynotjosh (Yellow Josh)

The Wart deviates from Exploriaria designs, wearing sleek armour, high-tech omni-shielding, using advanced fuel-hungry engines, wielding an all-energy weapon armament whilst retaining the ruggedness that War Drones are known for even when the War Drones they were made with were never given advanced technology from the Domain. It makes many of those in the higher echelons of Hegemony and Tri-tachyon society nervous. Where did the War Drones attain this technology? How can fleets on different corners of the sector field these? Are they sharing designs with each other? Is this the beginning of a new breed of Mutant High-tech War Drones?

“Derelicts don’t have shields, how does it have Plasma burn?! Are those Ion weapons!?”
“The hell I know! This thing outmanoeuvres our destroyers! They are hitting our shields... we are overloa-!”
- Recovered audio recording of an unknown prospector shortly before being destroyed

The Wart is an anomaly, a mutation, it should not exist, and yet it does, ripping man asunder.
