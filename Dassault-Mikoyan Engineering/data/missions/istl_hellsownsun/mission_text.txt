The nervous energy before battle. Sitting in the cockpit, like awakening on a foreign shore. Tension, cut only by the warm, comforting subliminals pumping through your loyalty implants. A mix of righteous anger with just a dash of resolution, a sense of noble purpose.

The interlopers have come snooping around. Fools. Don't they know? The Substance belongs only to the elect, those with the will and the strength to use it properly. To clean the Sector out, to purify the vermin.

This can't be permitted. We'll stop them.
