A rescue gone awry has left your cash-strapped contract mining fleet low on supplies, bereft of even a modest cargo, and now responsible for an unconscious, unidentified miner in four-point restraints down in sick bay, screaming that 'they'll kill us all! All of us!' every hour, on the hour. She's got a nice voice, but even so, it's starting to get old.

A sensor ping resolves itself into a small fleet of unidentifiable enemy craft, and suddenly, you have a pretty good idea who 'they' are, and what might be on their minds...

Well, you've always been the contrary type. Twelve years ago you fought Guarantor Mikhail's bullyboys in the streets and alleys; what are this bunch going to do to you - exile you to the Belt?
