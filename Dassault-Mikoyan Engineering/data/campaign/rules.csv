Small kiosks around the ring sell flash-fried fish- and squidlike creatures, native to Odessa but tank-grown on station, with an assortment of spicy-sweet sauces. You wonder, as you suck the last greasy traces off your fingers, what the aboriginal cetaceans would make of this canned overview of their existence.
