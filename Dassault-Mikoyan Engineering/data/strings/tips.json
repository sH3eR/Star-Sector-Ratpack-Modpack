	tips:[
	"[DME] Ships with built-in missile weapons benefit from setting their fire groups to LINKED. Voltigeur ASMs are especially effective in simultaneous launches.",
	"[DME] Dassault-Mikoyan weapons are more specialized than their vanilla equivalents. In return, some of them have higher per-shot damage, burst damage, shot speed, or flux efficiency. Plan your loadouts to maximize these benefits.",
	"[DME] All mainline Dassault-Mikoyan ships have high EMP resistance and quick overload recovery thanks to their built-in hullmod, Monobloc Construction.",
	"[DME] The Snow Goose is a specialist hunter-killer hull - it fares poorly without fleet, and especially anti-fighter, support. In return, it can fight enemy cruisers and capital ships surprisingly well for a destroyer.",
	"[DME] Dassault-Mikoyan markets have lower tariffs than vanilla Starsector or most other mod factions.",
	"[DME] Most Dassault-Mikoyan ships aren't good toe-to-toe brawlers - instead, rely on your above-average mobility to flank, and mass fighter strikes to reduce heavier enemies. It rarely pays to slug it out with other ships - instead, disengage and find a new target.",
	"[DME] Dassault-Mikoyan plays well when allied to a slow, tanky faction like the Hegemony; their own ships focus on cruiser- and fighter-centric maneuver warfare.",
	"Don't forget to hydrate! Drink water regularly, especially while playing Starsector.",
