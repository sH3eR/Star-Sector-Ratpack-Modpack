    # Points toward the online master .version file. This mod works by comparing
    # the local and online version to see if there is a newer version available.
    #
    # The master file must be:
    # - Online (duh)
    # - Directly reachable (the URL goes to the raw file, not a redirect page)
    # - Permanently linked and editable without the URL itself changing
    #
    # Bitbucket, GitHub, and other online repositories make excellent hosts.
