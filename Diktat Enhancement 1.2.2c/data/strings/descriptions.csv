station_opis_mining,CUSTOM,"Once the battlestation orbiting Opis, this station defended its host planet with an unbreakable veneer said to scare off all but the bravest(or most suicidal) enemies. When Opis was destroyed by the Planet-Killer device, the station itself escaped destruction, though it was heavily damaged. Trailing fusion fire and lacking many vital components, most, including the Sindrian Diktat at the time, left it to drift in the Opis Ring as yet another derelict structure.

Away from the prying eyes of the Diktat, a minor Independant polity formed within the dessicated hulk of the station, fending off prospective looters and subsisting on occasional supply shipments brought in by passing convoys. After a decade of such living, faced with the detiororation of what was left of the station's life support systems and the rapid worsening of living conditions aboard, the polity signed an agreement with the Sindrian Diktat; in return for refurbishing the station into workable condition, the polity would join the Sindrian Diktat.

Nowadays, the rechristened Opis Mining Platform acts as the central collection hub and processing facility for mining operations spanning the mineral rich Opis RIng. Retaining its combat modules from the days of the Askonia Crisis, it acts as a safe port for those who wish to earn a fortune mining rich ore belts or tech-mining the remains of Opis, yet are not quite as desperate as the workers at Cruor. Since it's restoration, millions of refugees from Volturn have been moved to the slightly more comfortable hab-rings of the Opis Mining Platform, swelling its population and providing the industries there with plenty of fodder to put to work.",,"Many critics, both within and outside the Diktat have criticised the continued existence of the Opis Mining Platform, as well as questioned the payout for the otherwise considerable effort needed to restore a station of such scale to the state it currently operates at. Of course, the Diktat would never make such an investment for such trivialities as sentimentality; as your shuttle lands on the docking strip and you dis-embark, the massive sheets of metal being prepared for export around you make clear the Diktat's purpose for restoring such a structure.

Not only being the main orbital defense of Opis, Opis Station also contained an extensive refinery on a scale not possible anywhere else in Askonia. While much of the refinery was heavily damaged during the Askonia Crisis and was hence rendered inoperable, DIktat efforts to restore this facility have proven successful and now, the Opis Mining Platform is a major exporter of metals and transplutonics, raking in a considerable profit this way as well as further alleviating Diktat reliance on exports.",
station_salus_siphon,CUSTOM,"A comparatively new station compared to other structures like the Opis Mining Platform, this station was intended to be the crux of Sindrian Diktat autarky policies, to rid them of a persistent volatiles crutch that existed since Umbra broke off from the Diktat. Whisking volatiles from the magnetosphere of Salus, the station provides the Diktat with a modest supply of volatiles, which is nontheless essential to the Diktat's efforts.

Unlike the older stations of Sindria and the Opis Mining Platform which follow after their original builders, the Domain, in low-tech design, or like Volturn Station which took after the midline school of thought, the Salus Siphon Platform uses techniques and styles from the high-tech school of design. This has lead to controversy about how the Diktat built the station, with the most popular theory being that the Diktat hired the Tri-Tachyon to build, or haul, a station there. Such baseless rumours are vehemently denied by Diktat officials.",,"Unlike the crowded bustle of other Diktat territories like Volturn or Sindria, the Salus Siphon Platform is sparsely populated in comparison. Only a population in the mere tens of thousands live here, mostly professionals who have the expertise necessary to operate the delicate siphon equipment. As the station itself was not built to accomodate large masses of people, refugees were not allowed aboard it, with only a few with the aforementioned skills being allowed to reside there.

The docking zone is fairly empty, likely due to this reason; Only a few ships have landed here, mostly traders looking to ship volatiles somewhere else or Diktat convoys performing in-system routes to Sindria. Of course, it isn't a Sindrian Diktat territory without the propaganda; Everywhere you look, posters and holograms proudly showing the Lion's face to everyone in sight can be seen.",
planet_drakon,CUSTOM,"Named for the dragon-like megafauna that once dominated the planet, Drakon is a mercilessly cold world rivaling even Umbra in frigidity. Much of the organics harvesting and processing plants lie underground, with almost no sign of human habitation on the surface. Not many would come here willingly, feeding rumours that the Diktat sends their prisoners here to work their usefulness away deep under the frozen crust.

According to archaelogical finds, Drakon was once a lush paradise in the heart of the Askonia system, enjoying the warmth of its parent star when it was still middle-aged. However, a few hundred million years ago, Drakon suffered a catastrophic collision with another planetary body, causing the extinction of much of the local fauna and sending the planet into a slow spiral outwards from the Askonia system. Eventually, anything that survived the initial impact died to the lowering temperatures, as Drakon slowly but surely froze over. Not even the aging of Askonia into a red giant could heat up the now long-frozen planet. By the time the Domain arrived, it was nothing different from hundreds of other barren rocks in the Sector.

What remains of life on this planet was buried deep under its crust; massive oceans of organics dwell underneath Drakon, occasionally erupting onto the surface in black gouts that soon freeze, forming bands of greyish black along the planet's surface. However, these massive reservoirs of organics went untouched until recently, as nobody would willingly immigrate to such an inhospitable world without payment, and most decided that the costs of hazard pay overruled any possible profits made. This changed when the Diktat arrived; supposedly, they did so as they could waive the costs of hazard pay by bringing in prisoners from Cruor; helping them secure the profitable organics reserves for minimal costs. Of course, these are all frivolous rumours propagated by anti-Diktat elements; surely no faction would be so heartless as to force prisoners onto this hellhole of a planet.",,"From orbit, the planet seems almost dead; only the flickers of lights surrounding surface-bound maintainence and emergency shafts serve as evidence that humans even live on it. The entire planet is only serviced by a single, small port; and this port itself is nothing more than a large hole drilled into the ground protected by a massive set of blast doors. Evidently, the Diktat did not intend for this planet to see heavy traffic; the only other ships that come here are those of mercantile convoys ferrying organics to other markets.",
planet_parthevia,CUSTOM,"The barren moon of Drakon, this body is theorized to have formed out of the debris surrounding Drakon after the collision that pushed it out to the fringe of the Askonia system. Despite this, the moon did not have much characteristics or resources of interest for the Diktat, hence never being colonized.

Despite the apparent disinterest towards this moon by any major power, tales of weak EM signatures and faint lights being observed from this planet have sowed the seeds for conspiracy theories claiming that Parthevia is home to a series of underground secret Diktat military bases testing novel and experimental technologies. Such rumours are generally brushed off as the ravings of madmen by more sound-minded spacers.",,,
de_diktat_cnc,CUSTOM,"The heavily armed and shielded bastion over Sindria, this massive station takes solemn guard over its host planet, and hosts much of the administrative structures for governance of the planet below, whenever deemed too valuable to risk being put with the commoners and possible terrorist attacks. Some say it keeps an eternal, watchful eye on Sindria, waiting for any sign of dissidence to pop up, and disappear them into the pages of history. To that point, it's often depicted in Sindrian folk stories as a thousand-eyed deity, watching for anyone who steals, cheats or sleeps too late at night to drag them to Hell.",,"Upon closer inspection, it becomes obvious that the station once had a large coat of Lion's Guard paint; however, intense solar winds from Askonia have long since stripped most of it off, leaving nothing but dirty streaks of the once grand crests dotting the station. Closing in to the gigantic station, it's obvious every part of it is also heavily armoured head to toe; as well as signs of what you identify as a station-wide variant of Solar Shielding. Docking inside a large hangar bay guarded by an intimidatingly large set of blast doors with the Diktat crest painted over them, you depart your shuttle and move into the depths of the surprisingly crowded station.",
de_volturn_juturnus,CUSTOM,"Once a luxury habitat containing the system's finest casinos and residences to please the wealthy, the Juturnus Control Garrison's role hasn't actually deviated too far since then; the station serves as the residence of anyone priveliged enough to not be forced to live on Volturn's actual surface. With its vast casino hallways converted into military barracks, it now serves as the local headquarters for the garrison that keeps a shaky rule over the riotous planet below.",,"The station still sports glamorous arches and pillars all along its berth, tasteful remnants of its former role; while much of this has been preserved, the lower arches have noticeably been crudely cut open to sport large ship hangars for the garrison's patrols. Midline combat modules, hastily welded onto the upper sections of the station, lazily track your fleet's arrival with their weapon arcs.",
phrygian_immigration,CUSTOM,"The Phrygian Immigration Checkpoint is a small station put into orbit over the Salus L4 Jump Point by the Diktat to perform security checks, willing or unwilling, on any fleet that attempts to enter the system by this jump point. Crewed by a relatively small population due to the boredom of this job; most scans are autonomously conducted by Delta-level AIs and most personnel are solely there as punishment, because they fail to qualify for anything better or for some other reasons.",,"As you close to the station, your fleets report an intrusive fleetwide scan originating from it; evidently Phrygian will do its job regardless of consent. The admin you contact on it just tells you to ""not worry about it"".",
planet_bardonia,CUSTOM,"Primarily composed of hydrogen and helium gases. The temperature and pressure at the core are extreme, but not enough to sustain the deuterium fusion that would turn the planet into a brown dwarf star.

Before the Collapse, Bardonia was renowned for its posse of moons, meticulously terraformed into lush paradises that each provided a unique and memorable view. From thick tropical jungles to vast grassy plains, towering redwood forests to shifting desert sands, each moon offered an experience nothing like the one before. Known as the number one tourist attraction in the local galactic venue and a must-go for any vacationeer this side of the galaxy, the moons enjoyed a wealth of income from their lucrative tourism industries.

However, everything changed when the Collapse occurred. Suddenly cut off from their main(and in many cases only) form of income, society on many moons quickly decivilized. The few remaining civilized moons survived on crude and previously useless secondary industries, banding together to form the Andor Polity. Despite this, the moons retained their lush biospheres and such jewels were too valuable to simply ignore for the major powers of the Sector. Many of these moons were colonized by the Hegemony, League, Tri-Tachyon and even some taken by privateers and independants. There existed a tenuous peace between them for decades.

Though, if one looks on now, the moons of Bardonia look nothing like the tourist worlds they once were. Many are now barren balls of rock, retaining no trace of life or anything economicaly useful at all. Nobody quite knows what happened to them; any residual information that was not deleted with the Hypernet was thoroughly censored by Tri-Tachyon for reasons unknown. The only known information about this event is that it is called the Razing of Bardonia's Moons among spacers, and that it resulted in almost all of Bardonia's moons becoming barren wastelands. Of course, there are always rumors, conspiracies and theories but most are so far-fetched they could only be the work of a rad-addled mind that's spent far too much time under a Gremlin's phase coil.",,,
planet_bardonia_moon_generic,CUSTOM,"Once one of Bardonia's ""tourist moons"", this moon is barren and dead now for reasons unknown. A thin, reduced atmosphere stubbornly clings on to the moon, a remnant of its once habitable atmosphere. A cursory scan brings up meagre deposits of ores and rare ores, but considering the danger of settling a colony here and their miniscule quantity, it would be unwise to colonize this moon.",,,
planet_ravaryea,CUSTOM,"The newest of Bardonia's ""tourist moons"", Ravaryea was in the midst of being terraformed when the Collapse occurred. It was relatively unaffected by the chaos of the Collapse as no humans lived on the moon at that time, and the terraforming drones slowly turned it from the barely-habitable rock it was on the eve of the Collapse into a lush jungle world. The League was in the midst of preparing a colonization convoy to it when Ravaryea, like all of Bardonia's moons were suddenly reduced back into barren rocks. In a twist of fate, whatever had consumed Ravaryea's biosphere did not, or could not, severely damage the terraforming drones that had created that biosphere, and they resumed their mindless work, re-terraforming Ravaryea. Now, due to their work, it is the only habitable moon in Bardonia's orbit, even if ""habitable"" may be a minor overstatement.

The razing of Bardonia's moons permanently cut any major faction's interest in the system; it's only strategic value depleted, most factions made no move to recolonize Andor. Hence, the Diktat managed to pluck Ravaryea out from under the other power's noses; it is now a bastion of authority in the Andor system, or whatever authority is left anyway.",,"Ironically, Ravaryea has followed in the footsteps of the other moons of Bardonia, earning much of its profit from tourism related activities, while still maintaining a decent secondary profit from farming and mining activities exploiting its modest reserves of organics. With the more terraformed parts of Ravaryea boasting bountiful jungles rivaling those of Jangala while not having a human-deadly biosphere, or without the cumbersome anti-technology restrictions placed on tourists on Gilead, there is understandably a high demand to spend a vacation on what is one of the more beautiful planets in the Sector with few of the disadvantages to boot. To this end, Ravaryea contains the highest percentage of tourist attractions in the Sector; definitely a must-go for any prospective traveler with enough credits in their pockets. Even the Diktat has been quick to play themselves into this advantage, making the planet as accomodating as possible for tourists from any faction.",
planet_bardonia_moon_pirate,CUSTOM,"Once one of Bardonia's ""tourist moons"", this moon is barren and dead now for reasons unknown. A thin, reduced atmosphere stubbornly clings on to the moon, a remnant of its once habitable atmosphere. A cursory scan brings up meagre deposits of ores and rare ores, but considering the danger of settling a colony here and their miniscule quantity, it would be unwise to colonize this moon.

Despite this, privateers have set up a small settlement here, mostly for the purposes of raiding Ravaryea. Small, crude hab-domes lie scattered across the moon's rocky surface,  blinking lights pock-marking the ceaseless gray surface. While originally intending to raid Ravaryea for profit, the pirates here more often find themselves raiding for food and supplies just to keep their settlement going, as any and all incoming shipments are scrutinized thoroughly by Diktat patrols. This has made the colony rather unpopular among pirates, and only the foolish or desperate would come here willingly.",,,
planet_farnau,CUSTOM,"What formerly appeared to be a massive Venus-like planet with a thick atmosphere, much of Farnau's atmosphere was blown away when Andor transitioned into a blue supergiant. While what remains contains a high concentration of useful minerals, Farnau's close proximity to its star and the resultant consequences on it outweighs any possible benefits of exploiting these rich bands of ores.",,,
planet_savras,CUSTOM,"Once one of Bardonia's ""tourist moons"", this moon is barren and dead now for reasons unknown. A thin, reduced atmosphere stubbornly clings on to the moon, a remnant of its once habitable atmosphere. Unlike the other moons, Savras' surface does not yield even the smallest deposits of useful minerals; almost as if it had been picked clean by an unknown force.",,"Once the ""capital"" of the Bardonian Moons Tourism Association, it was the place where travellers would initially stop at before embarking on sub-burn transport shuttles to the other moons. Now it lies dead much like the other moons of Bardonia. Surprisingly enough, your scans indicate that there are a few weak EM waves being emitted from various points on the planet's surface. Their distance from the ruins of starports and the non-civilian wavelength implies that they were likely military in origin, while the relatively strong signals imply they were far more recently built than the civilian structures. Further scans indicate that most of the sites were ravaged by the Razing of Bardonia's moons; almost nothing remains, and anything that could have been salvageable was looted long ago. ",
andor_viewport,CUSTOM,"Formerly a luxurious orbital made to present wealthy tourists with a picturesque view of the system's asteroid belt and main star, this structure was abandoned soon after the Collapse as its lack of self-sufficiency drove the workers and remaining tourists there to depart in the hopes of finding a better world or station to call home. Now, the refurbished structure acts as a training ground for prospective Lion's Guard officers, in preparation for active duty in Askonia. Due to this, the facility sports a modern military base, whose fleets protect both the Viewport and nearby Ravaryea.",,"The cavernous spaces of the luxury villa-modules have been converted into classrooms, training zones and dorm-modules for up-and-coming Guard officers, with the hallways packed with these promising candidates. The station, surprisingly, sports a crude Heavy Industry base, which is populated by students of the Guard Academy here on part-time jobs. Working in the Heavy Industry here is considered an honourable way to serve the Lion of Sindria, and hence the assembly lines never experience a shortage of willing workers.",
andor_relay,CUSTOM,"Once used to provide the highest quality FPS to tourists watching holovids on their TriPads from hotel rooms on the Moons of Bardonia, this relay now transmits and receives data between star systems at impressive faster-than-light speeds, even among other Domain-era comm relays. The rapidly pulsing hyperwaves suitable for FTL data transmission have been shown to damage DNA so these relays are always stationed away from habitats.",,,
planet_lennox,CUSTOM,"Like Ismara, Lennox was the perfect location to install mines and mass-driver facilities to launch mega-tonne slabs of graphene-encased water and nitrogen packages toward the inner system to nurture the moons of Bardonia. Cycles before the Collapse, much of Lennox's infrastructure was already repurposed for other terraforming projects out-sector, leaving a skeleton crew to occasionally supplement the terraformers on Ravaryea with incoming comets of ice. When the Collapse occurred, this population of mere hundreds was able to leave the planet for better prospects, leaving Lennox as cold and dead as when the Domain first found it.",,"Much of Lennox's infrastructure had been stripped pre-Collapse; what was left has been looted long ago. Now, there is nothing but the bare foundation of hab-domes and mass driver tracks to see, and certainly nothing of use to salvage.",
ryzan_supercomplex,CUSTOM,"This once-modest siphon platform has been buried under dozens of hab-modules and armour segments ripped out from other stations over the course of a decade. While originally meant only to siphon volatiles from Ryzan, with support of various scavenged bastions and armour segments, it now forms a logistical hub for Diktat operations in the Andor system, as well as a fall-back capital for if Sindria is ever taken from the Diktat.",,"The station's previous administration was destroyed in a destructive civil war not long after the Collapse, leaving the station uninhabited for decades. The destruction wrought by the war left the station too broken to be deemed recoverable, and looters slowly took away portions of its superstructure before the Razing of Bardonia's Moons. After which, the station was never touched again until early 190, when the Diktat colonized it looking to exploit Ryzan's volatiles, as well as making it a potential logistics hub on a scale unachievable on Ravaryea or the Andoran Viewport, and unecenomical on any other Andoran body.

To this point, the Diktat went on a decade-long rampage; destroying Pather and Pirate bases where they stood, to bring their hab-modules and armour plates back to reinforce the Ryzan Supercomplex. A decade later, this paid off; the station is now covered with haphazardly bolted hab modules and coated in thick sheets of armour that could make an Onslaught look like a Kite in comparison. The combat modules were enhanced too; with the copius amount of battlestation-class modules and armour segments recovered from Pather bases, Ryzan Supercomplex now operates a star fortress matched only by Command and Control.",
planet_khuno,CUSTOM,"This small frozen colony of Tri-Tachyon was never of any great significance to the Corporation, and hence avoided annexation by the Hegemony for the same reasons. A lonely world, duty here is often considered a punishment for dissident or lazy employees, in the hope that the desolate environment would teach them to behave better in the workplace.",,,
planet_qui,CUSTOM,"A former Tri-Tachyon staging point for the Invasion of Chicomoztoc, Itztlacoliuhqui's near proximity to the Hegemony's capital garunteed its annexation by the Hegemony. However, mere days before the handover, Itztlacoliuhqui's administration underwent a catastrophic collapse and the planet decivilized, with the remaining populace destroying anything that could still be looted from the military base there. The Hegemony blamed Tri-Tachyon for causing the collapse, while Tri-Tachyon denied involvement in what it said was an isolated incident. In any case, with the military base looted and with no other resources on the planet being of sufficient interest to justify recolonization, the planet was left empty.",,"Orbiting over the planet, your sensors detect EM readings from low-grade handheld weaponry and guided rockets; looking to where the military base once stood, what is left has been shattered, blasted and thoroughly vandalized.",
planet_kukayin,CUSTOM,"Once a major Tri-Tachyon military base second only to Culann, its proximity to the Persean League and its established military facilities made it a tempting target for the Hegemony. However, a few days before the expected handover, the planet's administration unexpectedly declared independence from Tri-Tachyon. While the Hegemony could still invade and take the planet by force, attacking an otherwise innocent independant polity would not sit well among the public, hence the colony was left as it is. Now, Kukayin is a large independent military base renowned more for its prodigious sales of drugs than its military prowess, being a consistent pain in the rear for the other colonies of Zagan by encouraging the proliferation of in-system smuggling.",,"The independent polity governing the planet surprisingly retained many features of its Corporation parent; a corporational structure, liberal laws on commodities and lower tax rates. However, one notable difference is that the polity treats its workers notably better than the Corporation usually does. Drug usage is a common practice here, less out of neccessity and more out of a deep-seated culture prevalent amongst the former Tri-Tachyon employees that once worked here, and still is popular amongst the citizens here.",
planet_cailleach,CUSTOM,"This frozen ball was, believe it or not, once a lush water world orbiting in a curiously binary orbit with similarly-sized Bheur. While many interesting phenomenon have been implicated to occur between the two, Hybrasil's collapse into a white dwarf froze the two planets, locking their oceans under metres-thick ice drifts. Despite this, large pockets of ocean thousands of kilometres wide still exist deep under Cailleach, which are now being exploited for their agricultural benefits.",,"Pre-Collapse, the planet's only inhabitation was a small research base dedicated to investigating the planet's binary orbit with Bheur, as well as its semi-frozen ocean, helmed by Tri-Tachyon. Post-Collapse, the research base was quickly refurbished into a full on settlement, the subterranean seas dredged with fish farms and kelp plantations which help Cailleach export a sizable quantity of food.",
planet_bheur,CUSTOM,"The binary sister to Cailleach, Bheur still retains subterranean seas like its sister planet, but unlike Cailleach, Bheur's seas are laden with large quantities of soluble toxic minerals that prevent them from being used agriculturally. This, alongside a few other factors made it a less desirable locale to colonize compared to Cailleach, and hence no settlement was founded here.",,,
planet_aisoyim,CUSTOM,"Once a moderately-sized Tri-Tachyon military base, Aisoyimstan was handed to the Persean League by Tri-Tachyon in the face of its imminent defeat in the Second AI War, preventing it from being seized by the Hegemony in the Treaty of Crom Croach. While this angered the Hegemony, they ultimately did not do anything to stop the transfer and this colony now acts as a strong bastion in the depths of League space.",,,
erreichen_freeport,CUSTOM,"Once a bustling independent freeport serving as a bastion of legal and illegal trade bound for the inner Andoran markets utilizing Erreichen's rings as a source of mineral export and smuggling cover, this station was destroyed by a violent Diktat crackdown on its activities in 192; intended not only to stop the station's influence on smuggling into Diktat territories, but also to display to the other factions the Diktat's military might. The bloody conflict involved dozens of ships lost, thousands of dead on both sides and ultimately resulted in the gutting of the station by an intentional reactor self-destruct in a final act of retribution towards the Diktat by the ruling polity. Its cold, dead wreck now slowly orbits Erreichen in a pool of its own detritus, a grim reminder of the Diktat's military strength.

While the act of hostility towards an otherwise neutral entity was met with widespread condemnation throughout the Sector, no major faction took decisive action. The operation was a success not only in neutralizing the port's influence on unlawful operations in Askonia, but also of convincing the major powers in the Sector of the Diktat's military prowess, and no faction was willing to undertake what was likely to be a long and bloody conflict to remove the Diktat from power.",,,
planet_erreichen,CUSTOM,"Erreichen is what Old Earth astrologists would call a ""Super Saturn""; dominating Andor's outer system, this massive ice giant has coalesced most of the primordial matter left from Andor's birth into massive, awe-inspiring rings dwarfing those of Saturn. Visible even to the naked eye even from the inner system, this foreboding giant is a magnificent sight to behold, and it's dense rings provide the perfect cover for smugglers negotiating illegal trade of goods on the Andoran fringe.",,"Even from here you can see the distant flicker of lights and faint EM readings that signal small roider fleets in Erreichen's rings. Many spacefarers make their livings off mining asteroids in the rings, and more often than not, live and die amongst them too; asteroid habitats are not an uncommon sight here, and the chaotic nature of the ring means one moment of distraction and one's ship could be smashed into twisted scrap by a hurtling asteroid.",
planet_duden,CUSTOM,"Duden is a relatively new planet in astronomical timescales; only having been birthed a mere million or so years ago from the coalescing of asteroids in Erreichen's rings. While this birth has gifted it with higher-than-average mineral composition, its high hazard rating would dissuade all but the most desperate entrepreneurs from setting up a mining outpost here.",,,
drone_hub,CUSTOM,"This station was used to coordinate the waves of drone miners that seasonally mined Nortia pre-Collapse, acting as a hub for mining operations. After the Collapse,  the station remained operational, but was eventually sabotaged by Pathers in cycle 83 due to allegations of AI core usage on the station. The act left the station crippled and incapable of further operation, which led the independent polity controlling Nortia at the time to leave it abandoned. Ever since then, the station has not been restored by any succeeding government, leaving it to slowly drift over Nortia.",,,
planet_fornois,CUSTOM,"This small planetoid was formed out of collisions of asteroids in Bardonia's L5 Lagrange Point, and over the millenia has converted many of the asteroids in the L5 into impressive rings. Only the larger asteroids remain, unfortunately enough to semi-regularly bombard Fornois at a rate considered to be hazardous for any above-ground structures.",,,
planet_midgard,CUSTOM,"A large planet orbiting in the Largrange Point between Valhalla and Ragnar, Midgard sits inside the habitable zone of both stars and gets enough light from both to sustain photosynthesis and hence was considered a desirable terraforming candidate. Like Gilead, it was terraformed by the Eridani-Utopia Corporation to serve as a biological repository of flora and fauna species salvaged from Old Earth during its devastation by human-wrought climate change. After the Collapse, the administration on the planet sought independence from the ailing Domain, converting the planet's fertile soil into farmland and bolstering its population by assisting other colonies, eventually reaching a size and development rivaled only by Mairaath of the Mayasuran Terraforming Cabal. However, unlike Mairaath, Midgard has survived independence through the tumultous cycles since, serving as a shining star for the other independent colonies that there is yet hope for them.",,"Midgard's garrison, once only meant to deter piracy attempts and small rebellions, has expanded into a massive navy rivaling that of the greatest superpowers of the Sector, having stopped numerous incursions on Midgard, including one from the Hegemony. With their reputation so high, many people from all walks of life and allegiances come here to disappear from the eyes of the greater sector, protected from their aggressors by the massive fleets surrounding Midgard.

Not only do people come for safety, they also come for the sights and smells. As Midgard was one of the Domain's ""biological treasuries"", its biodiversity allows a large range of fauna and flora unheard of anywhere else. It makes for a remarkably diverse culture of cuisine using various exotic ingredients, as well as extremely profitable tourist attractions and great zoo material.",
station_midgard,CUSTOM,"The Valhalla-Ragnar Logistical Hub was, as its name states, a logistical centre for the Valhalla-Ragnar system, coordinating all other efforts in-system from the Asgard Orbital Complexes to the Volatiles mining operations on Skathi, as well as the planet below it. It also served a secondary purpose as a luxurious orbital for the administrators of Midgard to recline in, and a tourist destination for those interested in viewing Midgard's wondrous biodiversity from above. Post-Collapse, the Hub was rapidly converted into a military and residential complex, ring after ring of hab-modules and combat segments burying the original structure. Now it serves as the home of many hundreds of thousands, as well as the primary defense of Midgard beyond its fleets.",,"Living on Midgard itself is often a luxury; much of the poorer citizens of Midgard stay here instead, where housing prices are cheaper. Population on the station is higher than on Midgard itself, with a thriving food culture weaving its way up from the planet below into the station; the wet markets here sell a variety of street food not seen anywhere else, made with ingredients found only on Midgard.",
station_asgard1,CUSTOM,"The Asgard Orbital Complexes were heavy orbital stations built in Midgard's L4 and L5 Lagrange points by the Domain during the terraforming of Midgard. Imposing in their bulk, they served as military training bases and projection venues for the Domain across the local sectoral venue, as well as protection for Midgard and as the site of orbital work factories for the production of military components, fuel production facilities and refineries. After the Collapse, the administrations of these complexes had to scuttle or sell off much of the Domain-era components in the complexes to stay afloat, relying on supplies and food from Midgard to continue operating.

In cycle circa-85 post-Collapse, emboldened by the victories at Mairaath, the Hegemony launched an attack against Midgard and the two Asgard Orbital Complexes. The L4 Asgard Orbital Complex was seized by Hegemony forces, dealing a huge blow to the Midgardian polity. However, the Hegemony forces were eventually forced into a stalled battle over Midgard, causing massive losses and eventually prompting the High Hegemon to withdraw from Midgard amidst free-falling public opinion about the war. To this day, the L4 Asgard Orbital Complex serves as a Hegemony refueling post, refinery and military garrison, keeping an eye on Midgard.",,,

star_hesiod,CUSTOM,"The beginning of the end for most stars, the white dwarf was once a red giant not massive enough to fuse carbon. Extremely dense and slowly radiating away its heat as it no longer undergoes fusion reactions, its volume is supported against gravitational collapse only by electron degeneracy pressure.

However, Hesiod is noted for being an extremely young white dwarf on the stellar scale, having only begun the conversion from a red giant relatively recently on the stellar timescale. It is so young in fact that it still sheds what remains of its outer layers even now, finalizing the transformation into a white dwarf. This characteristic has left the immediate space around Hesiod saturated in isotopes and gases that find critical usage in AM fuel production applications.",,,
brontes_bay,CUSTOM,"The Brontes Bay Module was one of three hub modules that once made up the Apollodorus Harvesting Complex that rung all around Hesiod, now one of the only surviving remnants of the structure. The Brontes was built to accommodate large amounts of bulk cargo ships arriving to pick up raw volatiles and minerals from the Complex, and hence was the only module to sport large bays fit for even the largest of haulers.",,"While the structure is certainly looted thoroughly, the cavernous space the bays in the module provide can be used to store a vast quantity of ships and commodities alike.

The production capacity was never enough for export purposes.",,"Even from a distance, holes of varying size can be seen pock-marking the structure, from as small as a regular crew member to as large as a capital ship. These seem remniscent of detonations caused by destabilized AM fuel and have rendered much of the structure damaged.

arges_collection,CUSTOM,"The Arges Collection Module was one of three hub modules that once made up the Apollodorus Harvesting Complex that rung all around Hesiod, now one of the only surviving remnants of the structure. The Arges was built to act as a giant collector for the vast amounts of volatiles that still spew out of Hesoid, using a Plasma Dynamo(with relevant modifications) to catch as many volatiles as possible around the fading star.",,"The broken tendrils of giant fan-like collectors can be seen protruding from the lower half of the module, stretching to various heights. The famed Plasma Dynamo itself is still there; however sensory scans indicate that extended exposure to Hesiod's solar flares and radiation, as well as age have rendered it practically inoperable and hence useless...as well as a few massive munitions blasts in its side.

planet_cronus,CUSTOM,"A large and imposing gas giant, the only planet to survive Hesiod's transformation from a red giant to a white dwarf. The planet regularly captures gases from the surrounding space giving it the same plentiful isotopes as the nebular remnant it is situated deep in. The solar winds from Hesiod also indirectly contribute to massive storm cells and generally violent weather that rages across the planet.",,"Even from space the raging storms of Cronus can be seen; storms the size of terrestrial planets rage, urged on by winds that would blow away any atmospheric settlement that would be established on the planet. A peculiar sight is what seems to be a ring of small black dots along the equator of Cronus; likely the impact points of a ring of gas siphon platforms that apparently used to exist around Cronus according to Tri-Pad data, that were pushed into the planet by their own wear and tear and the force of solar wind against their failing boosters.",

They seem to have fallen at some point in the distant past though, as evidenced by the large amount of blaster holes and skeletons in the hallways, as well as shattered command towers with spent mortar rounds in them. A few clumsily spray painted slogans, suspiciously similar to a somewhar tilted Luddic Church symbol seem to hint at to who the culprit may have been responsible. And the Plasma Dynamo?

It seems to have been taken by a large explosion of sorts, although from salvaged schematics the reactor was in the upper half of the station. Speaking of the upper half, it sports ancient weapons markings, and is a mostly mangled wreck that has since been picked clean by the occasional passing scavenger.",

The Plasma Dynamo is, as expected, gone from its slot; probably looted off by scavengers. What is peculiar is that signs seem to indicate that the Dynamo was taken recently; very recently. Possibly in the last decade or so, compared to the rest of the station which seems to have been looted near completely likely before cycle 100.",
planet_redacted,CUSTOM,"Surprisingly enough, the Tri-Pad brings up nothing on this peculiar planet; not even the stereotypical description used for planets of its class. Unusual, as the planet seems mostly non-anomalous from a far view. Perhaps a closer look might be warranted.",,"Upon closer inspection, the planet seems to be pock-marked with holes of varying size; some seem like natural craters formed by meteorite impacts, but a majority of them bare characteristics all too similar to the aftermath of munitions impacts on ship hulls, solidifying the theory among many of your officers that the planet seems to be some sort of colossal testing ground for weapons by the Domain. Although, some of the craters look fresher than others. One notable crater is a massive one directly underneath the mysterious station orbiting it; magma still flows between the cracks, implying it was made recently.",
weapons_plat,CUSTOM,"This small station seems to be hidden in low earth orbit over the planet; its orbit tailored specifically to keep as close to the planet as possible to avoid detection. Despite this, it seems to have not escaped looting, as the structure bares signs of an organized plundering by scavengers.

#Fighters,,,,,
de_flurry,SHIP,"The Flurry is a bomber designed to soften up enemy shields before a strike by other ships. While its payload is intimidating, the bomber's slowness and relative fragility undermine its effectiveness on the battlefield.

Due to lax regulations, undercut funding, and general apathy from Andrada, the Sindrian Diktat's few original fighter projects often mix zany ideas with incompatible hullmods, ending up with fighters that act more like proof of concepts than actually useful designs. The few that get the Lion's attention and manage to reach mass production in Diktat circles often don't perform quite as well as existing mass production fighters.

The Flurry was the brainchild of a minor fleet admiral whose only distinctive features was his downright cult-like obsession over Squalls, claiming that they were the ""one true missiles"" and that ""sabots can eat my burn"". To that point, he attempted to make an entire bomber focused solely around the Squall, which understandably did not go down well with most fighter development branches. Only in the Diktat's underfunded and undermonitored fighter development program could he get a confirmation for his design.

The Flurry's development was littered with structural issues and deficits, mostly corresponding to the large size of the Squall payload in comparison to the ship, reducing size for armour or engines. The half-hearted solutions to these problems resulted in the Flurry having an abysmal top speed and thin armour/hull plating for a fighter of its calibre. Another difficulty was the inefficiency of the Squall missiles on the payload; their unique arming system often meant they were shot down as soon as they were fired, or would find(and miss) targets completely separate from the bomber's target. These inefficiencies, coupled with the admiral's insistence on using pure Squalls, lead to the project being denied and stonewalled from mass production.

A new team was eventually appointed to head the Flurry's development, which extensively modified the Squalls used in the Flurry to better serve its purpose. Ironically, they were changed so drastically from the base model that the original admiral who initiated the project quit it out of rage that his beloved Squalls were being tainted.

The Bretasinge was born of a noble, yet shortsighted idea; the idea to strap a dual flak turret to a large fighter to make it the ultimate point defense fighter. However, this idea soon fell flat when confronted with reality; the Bretasinge's development, like the Flurry's, was riddled with issues, mostly born out of constraints of space. Rather unfortunately, the reactor, engine and coolant systems among others required to maintain a medium flak turret requires a ship at least at frigate size, yet the leads refused to give in and powered through, fixing these glaring issues with ever more haphazardous bandaid solutions, such as removing armour plating to increase speed, removing unecessary components, replacing a human crew with a Delta-class AI core and more.

The resulting fighter was massive; barely managing to get into the corvette weight class and hence LPC rights. Despite this, much of its armour plating is slipshod and weak, with many integral parts even exposed to space, making it much weaker than its size might imply. The removal of ""unecessary systems"" led to the Bretasinge losing its shield generator, and the usage of cheap, inefficient components to compensate for underfunding led to its turret suffering from permanent deficits in its function.

Its only real advantage is the sheer efficiency at which a dual flak turret shreds through any missile or fighter coming at it.

In a twist of fate, the Bretais' development went through surprisingly smoothly; downsizing the size of the Bretasinge chassis and its mount allowed for far more leeway for appropriate systems, meaning it could be outfitted to a far more reasonable standard. Usage of more efficient high-tech engines allowed for more space for shielding, armour and even specialized point defense systems to be installed on the chassis.

de_incisormaw,WEAPON,"An even larger variant of the Incisor MRM Pod, which boasts 5 missile launch tubes and a very generous munitions pool allowing for shield suppression even across longer battles.

Essentially a large metal spike atached to an engine, the Incisor MRM provides cheap kinetic fire support for ships that can't afford to fly in the frontlines. While the missiles are extremely fast and logistically cheap due to their small payload, their fragility means that even a small PD net can thwart them efficiently, while their underwhelming damage makes them less appealing than other kinetic options on the market. Best used in large amounts where their numbers can overwhelm the PD grids of enemy ships.

de_cruordriver,WEAPON,"An upscaled variant of the Heavy Mauler, outputting 5 shells at a respectable distance for a ballistic weapon. Often used as an intermediary between the Hellbore and the Hephaestus.

Commissioned by the Supreme Executor himself after he noticed a lack of intermediates between the slow but hard-hitting Hellbore and the fast but damage-lacking Hephaestus, the Cruor Driver was intended not only to give the Diktat Navy more choices for ship loadouts, but also to generate funds from the sale of its blueprints to other polities. Unfortunately, it's flamboyant nickname, no doubt chosen by the Lion of Sindria himself, turned off many prospective buyers, and even those who do actually use it refuse to use its real name, instead referring to it as the ""Super Heavy Mauler""; a major source of consternation for the Lion and his entourage.",,,
de_tacsuperlaser,WEAPON,"Paladin PD systems are hard to come by in the contemporary Sector; not only was it already an uncommon sight pre-Collapse, but its niche role of PD combined with the requirement of a large energy to mount it, as well as the corruption of most known Paladin blueprints meant it was rarer to see one in use outside the Tri-Tachyon Corporation than spotting a red Volturnian Lobster on Volturn. The solution to this by intrepid independent engineers was the Tactical Superlaser; essentially the core of a Paladin with 5 Tactical Lasers attached to it, this reborn Paladin now serves as a long-range support weapon favoured by captains of ships like the Sunder. While possessing advanced targeting systems from the Paladin allowing it to fire over allies, the horrific flux generation of the weapon ultimately meant it only became somewhat more popular than its predecessors.",,,

Often considered more a liability than a valuable asset by most commanders.",,,
de_gravitonlance,WEAPON,"A colossal variant of the modular Graviton Beam, built into the Voyager's right flank. When activated, uses power directly siphoned from the Voyager's reactor to rip open holes in spacetime at a rate and intensity previously unheard of. The horrific amount of gravitons generated by this action can heavily stress all but the toughest shields, while their excited nature and sheer numerosity cause them to deal hard flux rather than the usual soft flux of the smaller Graviton Beam.

Development went well initially, creating a cruiser that would have more robust vent and capacitor systems at the cost of thinner armour comparative to the Dominator. However, the Supreme Executor himself personally inspected its development around the halfway point, pointing out the fact that the ventral vent shafts looked similar to missile tubes and should hence be missile tubes, with no compromises. This lead to the Vanquisher gaining 2 in-built Squall tubes, complete with micro-forges allowing them to reload during a battle, at the cost of losing some flux dissipation and even more armour to fit replacement vent shafts. It was also installed with a special modification allowing it to utilize its flux to enhance the damage of equipped energy weapons.

In the end, while not squaring up to its rival the Dominator, the Vanquisher can still hold the battleline admirably well, using a combination of its inbuilt Squall missile tubes and Capacitor Augment to whittle down enemy lineships.

Ships made by the Sindrian Diktat are often hampered in productive quality by presence of tight constraints all across the board, as well as the meddling of the Supreme Executor Andrada in their development who often demands the addition or modification of systems plain illogical to the function or design of the ship. Another defining trait is that most were made to be produced from parts of other ships; usually stored and decommissioned hulls from the Night of the Navy Partition in 198, where Andrada decommissioned half the Diktat Navy overnight in an attempt to accelerate the development of the Diktat's autarky solutions to imported hulls.

Oddly large and bulky for a frigate, the Regulus is intended to be a leader for frigate formations, increasing the effectiveness of wolfpack-based fleets. Boasting a modified Drive Field Stabiliser that can improve the speed and acceleration of surrounding ships, as well as a robust PD-friendly weapons layout, its presence can greatly benefit the frigates it is intended to be around. However, its lackluster mobility can leave it struggling to keep up with its intended escorts; and due to this, the Regulus may often find a new role in cruiser or capital-heavy fleets, serving as a PD platform for slower ships, as well as improving their speed, despite the diminishing effects of the drive stabilisation effect on larger ships.",,,

de_gamaliel_proto,SHIP,"Itsdefinitely a ship, thats for sure. Its got a functional bridge, engines, weapons, shields, yknow, the stuff that youd expect a ship to be. The make and design is unfamiliar to me, but thats a given since this thing was literally hanging out in a top-secret weapons testing platform or something, heh.

But theres one thing that really confounds me about this ship. Theres a massive hollow space within the structure of the ship that extends across its area. There are plenty of machines and scaffolding stuffed inside it, but the way that its crudely connected into ripped out ports makes it look like it was never supposed to hold those parts they way theyre wedged in, like it was made for something else. Plus, the bridge seems incredibly ungainly and crudely attached to the rest of the ship; we had to do some emergency reinforcement on its connection to the main hull to keep it from falling off before we dragged it out the yard into space. Its really strange for whats supposed to be a spaceship - the bridge is the brain of the ship as they say, it should be counterintuitive to make the bridge that weakly attached.

If you ask meit reminds me of a shell. The way the walls of that hollow are made to be smooth, seemingly accommodating to flesh; some of the salvors reported that it felt amazing to touch, which is really weird for a place filled with unfeeling mechanical wires and trusses. Plus, some of the ports we found, really remind me of the way some cybernetics would stab wires into open ports of the arms or necks of their users, not coolant tubes or electrical wiring.

But what could potentially fit into that shell? No idea, Im an engineering officer chief, not a biologist.

sindrian_diktat,FACTION,"The Sindrian Diktat is a polity founded in a relatively recent Hegemony military intervention in the Askonia system led by Admiral Philip Andrada, formerly of the Hegemony Navy. Andrada's Hegemony psych profile describes him as ""intelligent, charismatic, yet prone to narcissistic excess"". In his words, the Diktat was ""formed in the crucible of the Askonia Crisis and with it a new people: a race of humans with emboldened spirit and clarity of purpose; stronger, possessing the will and determination to overcome the divisions and petty parliamentary politics that bred only chaos when tested by the collapse of the Gate System."" Considered by the Sector at large to be a military dictatorship.

Despite this, the Sindrian Diktat has managed to survive a tumultous two decades in power, cleverly taking advantage of political events to further its territorial claims, exploiting loopholes and gray areas in political statements, manipulating other factions and prying into the uses of Domain-Era tech like no other faction. Currently, the Diktat stands as a semi-legitimate power in the Sector, not because other factions respect it, but because a war to remove it from power would be far too bloody to justify the returns. Despite this, the situation of the Diktat steadily grows more and more tumultous by the Cycles; one begs to wonder just how long the Diktat can continue to hold its favourable position in the Sector's political landscape.",,,"# Andrada, has only got one ball

jovian_fuel_corps,FACTION,"The Jovian Fuel Corps was once a major megacorporation based on Jupiter that controlled much of the Domain's fuel production and volatiles harvesting industries. One of the Domain-endorsed friendly megacorporations, their speciality was in the efficient and mass collection of volatiles from gas giants, stars or wherever they may lie, as well as the equally bulk conversion of these volatiles into remarkably pristine AM fuel suitable for interstellar travel. To this end, they were the proprietary inventors of the Synchotron Core(as well as the Plasma Dynamo alongside Fabrique Orbitale; something that latter doesn't like to admit), both essential technologies for enhancing the quality and production rates of volatile compounds and AM fuel canisters respectively, as well as many other technologies unknown to the Persean Sector.

Post-Collapse, the few remnants of the Jovian Fuel Corps would flee to their local sectoral headquarters Sindria, a hub of fuel processing for the Corps, leaving their technologies abandoned and free for the picking for others. Sindria eventually joined the independent union surrounding the system of Askonia, while the Corps' abandoned tech would slowly be looted off by scavengers, with some factions even using them for their own purposes.",,,

station_opis_mining_PAGSM,CUSTOM,"Once the battlestation orbiting Opis, this station defended its host planet with an unbreakable veneer said to scare off all but the bravest(or most suicidal) enemies. When Opis was destroyed by the Planet-Killer device, the station itself escaped destruction, though it was heavily damaged. Trailing fusion fire and lacking many vital components, most, including the Sindrian Fuel Company at the time, left it to drift in the Opis Ring as yet another derelict structure.

Away from the prying eyes of the Sindrians, a minor Independant polity formed within the dessicated hulk of the station, fending off prospective looters and subsisting on occasional supply shipments brought in by passing convoys. After a decade of such living, faced with the detiororation of what was left of the station's life support systems and the rapid worsening of living conditions aboard, the polity signed an agreement with the Sindrian Fuel Company; in return for refurbishing the station into workable condition, the polity would join the Sindrian Fuel Company as one of its franchises.

Nowadays, the rechristened Opis Mining Platform acts as the central collection hub and processing facility for mining operations spanning the mineral rich Opis RIng. Retaining its combat modules from the days of the Askonia Crisis, it acts as a safe port for those who wish to earn a fortune mining rich ore belts or tech-mining the remains of Opis, yet are not quite as desperate as the workers at Cruor. Since it's restoration, a concerted information campaign has convinced millions of aspiring citizens to move to the Opis Mining Platform in hopes of a stable job as an asteroid roider, or perhaps to find technology in the ruins of the Ring that could further revolutionize the Sindrian Fuel Company's fuel-making process.",,"Many rivals, blinded to the ingenuity of the Sindrian Fuel Company, criticised the continued existence of the Opis Mining Platform, as well as questioned the payout for the otherwise considerable effort needed to restore a station of such scale to the state it currently operates at. Of course, the Sindrian Fuel Company would never make such an investment for such trivialities as sentimentality; as your shuttle lands on the docking strip and you dis-embark, the massive sheets of metal being prepared for export around you make clear the Sindrian Fuel Company's purpose for restoring such a structure.

Not only being the main orbital defense of Opis, Opis Station also contained an extensive refinery on a scale not possible anywhere else in Askonia. While much of the refinery was heavily damaged during the Askonia Crisis and was hence rendered inoperable, Sindrian efforts to restore this facility have proven successful and now, the Opis Mining Platform is a major exporter of metals and transplutonics, raking in a considerable profit this way as well as further alleviating Sindrian reliance on exports. Beyond this, the Platform has a considerably military garrison which works to protect the Sindrian Fuel Company's other franchises from raids by thieving pirates or bitter rivals.",
station_salus_siphon_PAGSM,CUSTOM,"A small station built over Salus, with a massive Plasma Dynamo forming its centerpiece. Nobody knows how the Sindrian Fuel Company obtained such elusive technology, or how they were able to obtain High-tech station parts, but this station serves as a local supply of volatiles, freshly dredged from Salus itself, keeping the Sindrian Fuel Company from having to rely on competitors for their volatiles demands.",,"Despite having a fairly small permanent population, the small station has a massively engorged landing pad; likely to accommodate the dozens of freight ships hauling volatiles to Sindria to be converted into the Sector-renowned Sindria antimatter fuel. Traffic around the station was horrible; and it took an hour to even secure a landing pad. It seems visiting captains are placed very low on the landing slot priority list.",
planet_drakon_PAGSM,CUSTOM,"Did you know that antimatter fuel isn't the only fuel the Sindrian Fuel Company exports? Here at Drakon lies the HQ of the far-less-popular organics branch of the Sindrian Fuel Company, dredging up hydrocarbons from Drakon's crust to be exported to polities too poor to afford the far superior Sindrian antimatter fuel. Or to scientists who want it for non-fuel purposes.

According to archaelogical finds, Drakon was once a lush paradise in the heart of the Askonia system, enjoying the warmth of its parent star when it was still middle-aged. However, a few hundred million years ago, Drakon suffered a catastrophic collision with another planetary body, causing the extinction of much of the local fauna and sending the planet into a slow spiral outwards from the Askonia system. Eventually, anything that survived the initial impact died to the lowering temperatures, as Drakon slowly but surely froze over. Not even the aging of Askonia into a red giant could heat up the now long-frozen planet. By the time the Domain arrived, it was nothing different from hundreds of other barren rocks in the Sector.

What remains of life on this planet was buried deep under its crust; massive oceans of organics dwell underneath Drakon, occasionally erupting onto the surface in black gouts that soon freeze, forming bands of greyish black along the planet's surface. However, these massive reservoirs of organics went untouched until recently, as nobody would willingly immigrate to such an inhospitable world without payment, and most decided that the costs of hazard pay overruled any possible profits made. This changed when the Sindrian Fuel Company arrived; supposedly, Auspicious Supreme Chief Overlord Executive President Gas Station Manager Philip Andrada used his charm to convince workers to work here, and that they toil proudly to serve the Sindrian Fuel Company. Old, grizzled spacers at bars may tell tales of forced labour by prisoners in the underground pumps of Drakon, but mere insane old men are certainly less trustworthy than everyone's favourite mascot Volturn-y the Volturn Lobster!",,"From orbit, the planet seems almost dead; only the flickers of lights surrounding surface-bound maintainence and emergency shafts serve as evidence that humans even live on it. The entire planet is only serviced by a single, small port; and this port itself is nothing more than a large hole drilled into the ground protected by a massive set of blast doors. Evidently, the Sindrian Fuel Company did not intend for this planet to see heavy traffic; the only other ships that come here are those of mercantile convoys ferrying organics to other markets, of which there are very few.",
planet_ravaryea_PAGSM,CUSTOM,"The newest of Bardonia's ""tourist moons"", Ravaryea was in the midst of being terraformed when the Collapse occurred. It was relatively unaffected by the chaos of the Collapse as no humans lived on the moon at that time, and the terraforming drones slowly turned it from the barely-habitable rock it was on the eve of the Collapse into a lush jungle world. The League was in the midst of preparing a colonization convoy to it when Ravaryea, like all of Bardonia's moons were suddenly reduced back into barren rocks. In a twist of fate, whatever had consumed Ravaryea's biosphere did not, or could not, severely damage the terraforming drones that had created that biosphere, and they resumed their mindless work, re-terraforming Ravaryea. Now, due to their work, it is the only habitable moon in Bardonia's orbit, even if ""habitable"" may be a minor overstatement.

Since nobody else wanted it, the Sindrian Fuel Company comfortably set itself up here. Nowadays, Ravaryea advertises itself as the go-to tourist spot for exhausted Sindrian workers or tourists alike, all under the sponsorship of Volturn-y the Volturn Lobster. Check out the Volturn-Coaster today!",,"Ironically, Ravaryea has followed in the footsteps of the other moons of Bardonia, earning much of its profit from tourism related activities, while still maintaining a decent secondary profit from farming and mining activities exploiting its modest reserves of organics. With the more terraformed parts of Ravaryea boasting bountiful jungles rivaling those of Jangala while not having a human-deadly biosphere, or without the cumbersome anti-technology restrictions placed on tourists on Gilead, there is understandably a high demand to spend a vacation on what is one of the more beautiful planets in the Sector with few of the disadvantages to boot. To this end, Ravaryea contains the highest percentage of tourist attractions in the Sector; definitely a must-go for any prospective traveler with enough credits in their pockets. Even the Sindrian Fuel Company has been quick to play themselves into this advantage, making the planet as accomodating as possible for tourists from any faction.",

The massive hole in the station was caused by an unfortunate incident during the removal of the rival's antimatter fuel from the storage rooms inside the station.

Any data which may claim otherwise is carefully-constructed propaganda construed by rivals too jealous to accept the fact that Sindrian fuel is better than theirs.",,"The station seems to be surrounded by many, many free-floating holoprojectors depicting a cheery Andrada and Volturn-y the Volturnian Lobster explaining in suspiciously excruciating detail how the convoy arrived to the station, talked the owners out of their ambitions and settled the issue without violence or bloodshed, ending with a quote on how anything that does not imply this is propaganda and false rumors spread by jealous rivals.

Despite this, the data does in fact seem to prove otherwise. The large amount of wrecks and scrap and the rad-spots on many parts of the station seem to imply that the talks were anything but peaceful.

The destruction wrought by the war left the station too broken to be deemed recoverable, and looters slowly took away portions of its superstructure before the Razing of Bardonia's Moons. After which, the station was never touched again until early 190, when the Sindrian Fuel Company colonized it looking to exploit Ryzan's volatiles, as well as making it a potential logistics hub on a scale unachievable on Ravaryea or the Andoran Viewport, and unecenomical on any other Andoran body.

To this point, the Sindrian Fuel Company went on a long journey to procure station parts from willing sellers. A decade later, this paid off; the station is now covered with haphazardly bolted hab modules and coated in thick sheets of armour that could make an Onslaught's armour belts look like a Kite's thin sheets in comparison.

Despite this, this terraforming seems to have conveniently occurred about the time Ravaryea's biosphere started destabilizing, and the official story has many holes in it...despite these glaring issues, anyone who attempts to challenge this official narrative often shut up a few months later, one way or another.",,"A sector-famous Company-operated tourism firm rules the planet; having turned it into a planetwide zoo, amusement park and nature reserve all-in-one. Tourists from all across the Sector flock to see the rare and beautiful sights, gaining the Company a non-insignificant portion of tourism credits. The firm even, without any concrete evidence, claims to have resurrected Drakon's famous draconic megafauna with escoteric genetech and ""will be installing it in our exhibits in the near future.""; a claim laughed off by most credible scientists. Plans to replace Volturn-y with new mascots based on these lifeforms have all been rejected so far.",
abiectis_hq_PAGSM,CUSTOM,"The Abiectis Military Headquarters, once a mere mining station nestled in the Stone River, acts as a secondary military HQ for the Askonia system, housing the old conventional guard after their disgraceful removal of their headquarters from Sindria by the Lion's Guard. To this day the station is still mocked by Lion's Guard officials as the inferior station to Command and Control; something the local authorities don't take in well.",,"The heavily armed station eyes you with countless laser trackers and weapon arcs as it takes a horrific amount of time questioning you of your every motive, as well as interrogating you about your views on the Lion's Guard before finally letting you dock. The bay, more like a military hangar than a civilian dock, sports mostly Company warships being tended to by teams of engineers, who look at you weird; probably not expecting civilian visitors.",
planet_umbra_fortress_PAGSM,CUSTOM,"Seat of the Penumbran High Fuelers, a local sub-franchise of the Sindrian Fuel Company. Economic activity consists of mining volatiles to be shipped off and made into superb-quality Sindrian Fuel. In the wake of the Askonia Crisis, Umbra willingly joined the rest of the system under the SFC to enjoy the rest of the system's prosperity and to perpetuate the superiority of Sindrian Fuel; accounts of an ""Askonian Refueling Consortium"", or a violent takeover of the planet are merely lies concocted by the meddling rivals of the Sindrian Fuel Company.",,"Far from Askonia's primary, Umbra is a frozen world of methane and ammonia where water-ice is like rock and may be found in mountainous outcroppings and boulders. A thin atmosphere of volatiles is formed on the starward side of the planet only to freeze again on the dark side. Most craters are filled in over time as this ""snow"" is deposited. There is some mining of heavier materials from the poor, rocky mantle buried many kilometers beneath the glacial crust. Habitats are burrowed deeply; life on Umbra is harsh but bearable, as a continued flow of supplies from the inner system continues to fuel the extraction of volatiles from the planet's atmosphere. Sindrian Fuel made from Umbran volatiles is often touted as ""organic"" or"" fresh"" in comparison to that made of volatiles from other sources, and according to reputable SFC-sponsored sources, slightly decreases the rate of fullerene soot buildup on starship engines, marginally improving burn speed. Curiously, many craters show odd formations of ice and dust; like the frozen landscape had been melted by weapons fire, then refrozen once more.",
planet_nortia_fortress_PAGSM,CUSTOM,"A large but anonymous metallic/silicate planetoid caught in the L4 point of Salus, Nortia was once dedicated to seasonal robotic mining operations and substance abuse before it was inundated with refugees during the Askonia Crisis. It now forms the strongest independent base of Charterist rebels in the system, but finds itself increasingly surrounded by Sindrian Fuel Company forces. While the SFC has made few concrete moves against Nortia's sovereignity so far, ambassadors have been quite earnest about their desire to accept Nortia as an official SFC franchise and share Sindrian Fuel together; a sentiment shared by few Nortia citizens.",,"Since the Crisis, Nortia's mining and refining centers have grown sprawling, tumorous rockfoam suburbs; here following mining tunnels beneath the surface, there bubbling up comm-arrays, solar collectors, and pressure domes, while the slender barrels of heavy batteries point into the black void, waiting for the day the Lion comes for them. Civil governance is carried out in the form of an agreement between the Charterists and a cartel of smugglers, now united part in neccesity and part in comradeship against the encroaching Diktat menace, while a surprising amount of Hegemony consulates and establishments have recently popped up among the domes and habitats.",

outpost_tiger_DE,CUSTOM,"Initially little more than an impromptu firebase constructed to give support to the SRA task forces assigned to the system in the midst of the Askonian Crisis, Outpost Tiger has grown into a sizable military installation, and something of a thorn in the side of the Diktat.  Several attempts have been made to expel the defenders, but so far the installation has managed to resist the Diktat military. Despite this fact, the recent drastic increase in Diktat influence and military control over the system has been much cause of concern for the SRA government in charge, and the outpost's security is no longer garunteed.",,"The prevailing atmosphere seems to be one of defiant hope; the determination that, despite now being faced with far greater odds, the people here may yet weed out a victory and keep their sovereignity for another day. Workers and soldiers great you with nationalistic fervor, confident in their prowess to beat back the Diktat menace again, as they did many times before.",
