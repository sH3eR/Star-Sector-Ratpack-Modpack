These terrifying crustaceans easily rip through planetary defenses, paving the way for a marine assault. However, installing and maintaining these pods requires a large logistical effort, not to mention cleaning up the mess if any Brutes escape while onboard. Increases the effective strength of planetary raids by %s, up to the total number of marines in the fleet.",These potent crustacean beasts increase the effectiveness of raids.,graphics/DE/hullmods/lobsterpods.png

Vector Triangulator,vectortriangulator,,0,Sindrian Diktat,"no_drop, no_drop_salvage",,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,DE.hullmods.VectorTriangulator,"A complex array of instruments at the heart of the Sagittarii utilise advanced calculations to allow for incredibly precise trajectorial and spatial deductions, greatly increasing the range of weapons. However, this array partially intrudes on the ship's ammo feeders and energy focusers, reducing the firerate and damage of ballistics and energy weapons respectively.","Increases the range of weapons greatly on this ship, at the cost of reducing ballistic firerate and energy damage.",graphics/DE/hullmods/vectortriangulator.png
Unknown Array,qliphotharrayincomplete,,0,Unknown,"no_drop, no_drop_salvage",,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,com.fs.starfarer.api.combat.BaseHullMod,"This ship houses a prominent back-mounted array of exotic tech and sensors that your engineers can barely make out; at least, according to the engineering notes pasted on the interior bulkheads. In practice, this rig's array is nonfunctional, deprived of most essential components that nobody knows how to get. What effects this array could have if it was completed is unknown.","It's experimental and incomplete, and what effects it could harbour are unknown.",graphics/DE/hullmods/qliphotharray.png

The frequency these instruments search for seem to be integrated with the Special Modifications found on Lion's Guard ships, via a series of deeply-embedded encrypted transmitters that only function if the special modifications are kept. The instruments seem to have an effective broadcast range of around 1000 units.",Grants buffs to ships with the Special Modifications hullmod.,graphics/hullmods/special_modifications.png
