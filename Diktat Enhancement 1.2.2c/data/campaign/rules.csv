Despite this, an oddity has been found; near the lower docks of the station lies a peculiarly sealed drydock, containing a ship that fails to follow most design specifications of known warships; it seems to hold no crew compartments, only a small compartment fit for an AI core, as well as an incomplete base for what seems to be a tail-based array of exotic nature. While advanced in make, the ship is evidently experimental and unfinished; many parts are gone, structural supports and beams sticking out in odd angles, and bare pipes lay exposed to the elements. Far from a complete ship.

However, the hull is still space-capable, and could be refitted into a rare, if somewhat lackluster trophy ship. All it would take to release it into your fleet would be the removal of the wall blocking the drydock off from space.","0:DEWeaponPlatGamalielTake:Take the prototype rig

""The Opis-Jovian Union(formerly The Askonian Charter): c+0 to c+181""

""The Opis-Jovian Union was a system-wide polity formed in c+21 by the Askonian Charter and the remnants of the Jovian Fuel Corps stationed on Sindria. At the time, the Askonian Charter was suffering from a lack of spaceborne patrol enforcement to defend themselves from regular pirate raids on convoys, while the Sindria remnants, while posessing a well-established military base, lacked resources for sustaining their population without imports. Signing a mutually beneficial agreement, both agreed to unify into the Opis-Jovian Union.""

""Now possessing both self-sustainability and self-defense, the newfound polity, similar to Midgard, christened itself as a neutral beacon of safety for all legal starfarers, attracting a large amount of refugees from other polities across the Sector in the process as civilization decayed to the bounds of the Core Worlds. Even as the major powers of the Hegemony and Persean League rose, and as the chaos of the First AI War raged around it, the Opis-Jovian Union stayed relatively stable for upwards of a century, only seeing minor incursions by Remnant and pirate forces.""",DEDiktatOpis3:Continue,
DEDiktatOpis3,DialogOptionSelected,$option == DEDiktatOpis3,,"""However, all was not well within the Union. A stubborn adherance to archaic democracy rules established in the first days of the Union led to a list of increasingly corrupt and inefficient leaders being elected purely out of necessity. Living conditions across the Union plummeted for most, with the richest spending millions of credits on giant luxury-arcologies on Volturn to spend their days in excessive opulence. Furthermore, the elites seemed to enjoy currying the Hegemony's favour in diplomatic discussions; raising fear that the Askonians may one day live under the rule of the likes of Eventide's snobby nobles, or have many of their rights curtailed due to the Hegemony's eternal martial law. This obviously did not sit well for the common people, with protests and riots becoming more commonplace as the cycles dragged on; the Union tried to keep these issues away from the eyes of other powers, but the assasination of the most recent elected leader became the straw that broke the camel's back.""

""Many of the hive-cities on Opis descended into civil war, with entire cities seceding from the Union, albeit temporarily as military forces were sent in to crack down on them. Despite the attempts by the Union to quell the unrest, the system-wide chaos was too widespread to fully quell and the planets of Nortia and Umbra even seceded from the Union, declaring independence themselves.""

""This unrest, called the Askonian Crisis, obviously drew the attention of the major faction powers; especially since many of the rebels demanded League membership, claiming their military might would help to protect Askonia from the encroachment of the Hegemony and that only this would solve the massive inequality plagueing the once-great polity. Of course, this did not go down well, and the Hegemony sent in a fleet to dismiss the unrest within Union, despite condemnations from any independent polity well-informed enough to know of the political situation within the Union.""

DEDiktatOpis4,DialogOptionSelected,$option == DEDiktatOpis4,,"""Most of the Fikenhild-produced holo-documentaries or Holo-Vision shows about the destruction of Opis tend to simply show the moon suddenly blowing up into a million fragments. However, according to handwitness accounts, this is far from the truth. According to eyewitnesses living on Opis at the time, 'First there was a soft rumbling. Like the feeling when a Hound or shuttle lands nearby you or if the radio is turned on too loud. But slowly over time, it got worse. The soft shaking turned more and more severe, causing all of my mugs to fall off the shelves all the time. Luckily they were made of Tri-Tach polymers and were built to withstand that, heh. People really only started panicking when the fissures started appearing. They used to be these wee little cracks the authorities would just pour dura-cement over and forget about. Yet they got bigger, like the rumbling. Pens, TriPads, chairs, dogs, people started falling in them, and eventually, they stopped coming out. Honestly I'd compare it to Cruor, the way the ground on that sorry rock shifts and groans. But it ain't nothing natural, let me tell you that. Well, after the fissures got really massive everyone just started running. Everyone who could, anyway. The authorities would begin holding mass transports in Starliners and it was horribly crowded in those things, and that accursed Hegemony fleet had to keep inspecting every single one of them anyway because of 'security complaints' or whatever. Anyways, I was lucky enough to spend all my credits off on a guy with a Hound who flew me straight out of the system into League space. In retrospect I was Ludd-blessed to have not been sold on Umbra for a quick buck. Guess there still are some good people in the sector after all...'""

""Only after the fissures rocked the planet, collapsing hive-cities, crushing hundreds of thousands in metres of rock and spewing magma all over what was left, did that explosion the Fikens love to portray happen, reducing the once-capital into a nondescript asteroid belt. That was the end of the Opis-Jovian Union; its capital shattered, its population in shambles, the fleets above it fighting amongst themselves.""",DEDiktatOpis5:Continue,
