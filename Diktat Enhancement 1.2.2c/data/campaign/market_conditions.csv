Volturnian Lobster Brutes,DE_Lobsters,TRUE,TRUE,DE.scripts.DE_Lobsters,"While often considered to be nothing but a Volturnian wive's tale made to get naughty children to sleep, Volturnian Lobster Brutes are very much real, at least if the video evidence of numerous body-cams is to be trusted. Massive, hulking brutes that can block an entire railgun round and stomp a heavily armed marine into paste, these brilliant blue beasts pose the final challenge for anyone wishing to take over, or raid, the Diktat's crown jewel. Even while some scoff at their existence and dismiss them as mere children's tales, the mere threat of their possible existence still prompts many to bring marines far in excess of what would be considered necessary to overcome $market's defenses.",graphics/icons/markets/lobster_pens.png,10

Scavenged Orbital Works,DE_Orbitalworks,TRUE,,DE.scripts.DE_Orbitalworks,"Above $market lies a sprawling conglomerate of myriad orbital industry components, brought here from all over the Sector by subservient Diktat salvage teams and cobbled together into a structure that can barely be called functional. While their age and makeshift nature means they are hopeless at producing even decently defect-free components, they are capable of ironing out minor defects from already fabricated hulls, allowing the Diktat to attain a ship quality level their Corrupted Nanoforge just falls short of.",graphics/icons/markets/autofactory.png,10

Patriotic Fervor,DE_Patrioticfervor,TRUE,,DE.scripts.DE_Patrioticfervor,"Due to the brutal crackdowns of dissent and persistent propaganda campaigns of the Diktat, much of their population has been indoctrinated to believe the Diktat is the one true ruler of the Sector and that all other factions are false prophets trying to clinch the golden prize to themselves. This has resulted in ultra-nationalistic patriotism being common among the Diktat civilians, which keeps them orderly while under Diktat rule, while also boiling up an absolute mess of riots, rebellion and dissent if the planet would be taken over by another faction.",graphics/factions/crest_sindrian_diktat.png,10
Company Loyalty,DE_Patrioticfervor_PAGSM,TRUE,,DE.scripts.DE_Patrioticfervor,"The Sindrian Fuel Company fosters a strong sense of kinship and bonding among its employees, and an unintentional side effect of this is that most if not all its employees view the Sindrian Fuel Company in a near-godly view. This has lead to a surprising lack of disturbances by employees under Sindrian Fuel Company control, perhaps unwilling to disappoint their peers or Volturn-y the Volturn Lobster. However, when rival companies attempt to set up shop on rightfully Sindrian-owned planets, these seemingly perfect employees suddenly transform into a raucous and violent crowd causing dissent and chaos, outraged by the fact that their new employer is a factually inferior fuel producer to the Sindrian Fuel Company.",graphics/DE/factions/crest_PAGSM.png,10
Titan Lobsters,DE_Titanlober,TRUE,,DE.scripts.DE_Titanlober,"Ever since the toppling of the Diktat's rule over Volturn, massive purple lobsters rivaling the size of small starships have been seen occasionally surfacing to the upper waters of Volturn, attacking and destroying arcologies with their massive pincers. These titanic mostrosities seem to be immune to anything smaller than spaceship-borne munitions, and have been causing much chaos themselves alongside the rioting arcologies and slum floats dotting the surface; luckily, for now, they remain merely an intriuging sight from space. Though, it is likely whoever wishes to control this planet will have to contend with them on the planet's surface.",graphics/DE/icons/markets/volturny.png,10
Megafauna Attacks,DE_Megafauna,TRUE,,DE.scripts.DE_Megafauna,"Titanic megafauna in the shape of large purple Volturnian Lobsters are known to attack and destroy arcologies occasionally, breeding paranoia and panic among the colonists and increasing planetwide unrest. These creatures are nigh unkillable and can only be driven off by a concentrated bombardment by airborne starships. For some inconcievable reason, they seem to attack far less often if the Diktat is in control of $market...as well as primarily target particularly dissident arcologies.",graphics/DE/icons/markets/volturny.png,10

Unstable Fusion Lamp,DE_Unstablelamp,TRUE,TRUE,DE.scripts.DE_Unstablelamp,"$market's overhead Orbital Fusion Lamp undergoes frequent fluctuations in output luminosity, stemming from its corrupted nature and the insufficient quantity of volatiles supplied to it. Effects can vary in severity; however, the mere possibility of a particularly damaging lamp fluctuation neccesitates heavy safety measures to safeguard the safety of the permanent population, as well as generates much unrest from locals who await the next blackout or lamp flare with bated breath.",graphics/DE/icons/markets/unstablelamp.png,10
