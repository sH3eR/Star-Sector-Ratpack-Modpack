//Code Courtesy of the Titan code from Interstellar Imperium by Dark Revenant
    /**
     * Anamorphic Flare Generator. This creates a lot of EMP flares in a tight group, exploiting a bug in the game to
     * create an effect similar to an anamorphic flare. To create the effect you want, you may need to do a lot of
     * tweaking. Keep in mind that the effect has a higher resolution and a greater computational cost with smaller
     * thicknesses; extreme values (0.01 and smaller) can result in odd behavior. This can cause bugs if used in some
     * particular cases, such as on a weapon that spawns free-floating EMP arcs.
     * <p>
     * @param origin Put any ship in here. Really, any ship. This CANNOT be null.
     * @param point Location of the anamorphic flare. You may need to offset this to the right and downward to get it to
     * be centered.
     * @param engine The base combat engine object.
     * @param brightness The visual brightness of the anamorphic flare. This can also be used to attenuate its size, due
     * to how it is shaped. Biased such that 1 equals maximum brightness, but it is possible to go above maximum
     * brightness, especially on lower thicknesses, due to how the anamorphic flare works.
     * @param thickness Thickness ratio of the anamorphic flare. A bit of a misnomer; it won't actually get thinner,
     * just longer, if you make this smaller. Do not use a value above 0.5 because otherwise the flare won't look like
     * anything. The resolution of the flare and the precision of the flare thickness and the computational complexity
     * of the flare all increase when the thickness is decreased. Values below 0.01 can have a huge performance hit.
     * @param angle The angle the flare points toward, in degrees.
     * @param spread Controls how misshapen the flare will be, in degrees. Use only for low thickness values (0.2 and
     * below).
     * @param fringeGain Multiplies the alpha of the outside color of the anamorphic flare, in case it wasn't colorful
     * enough for you. Not sure if this actually works... Default is 1.
     * @param fringeColor The outside color of the anamorphic flare. Alpha is not used.
     * @param coreColor The core color of the anamorphic flare. Alpha is not used.
