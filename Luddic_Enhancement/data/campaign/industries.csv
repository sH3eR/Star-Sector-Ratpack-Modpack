Under the careful watch of the Knights of Ludd, imported hulls and scavanged vessels are brought here and, through limited use of profane machinery and over-use of hard labour, brought up to acceptable quality. Naturally this process is exceptionally wasteful. Alexandrettans feel that this deep intervention in their industry by the Luddic Church is unfair, considering that the heavier industry on Asher is not as tightly controlled or regulated.",160.1
