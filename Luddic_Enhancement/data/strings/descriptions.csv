hermes_pather,SHIP,"Fanatics of the Luddic Path have made this ship their own, stripping out all unnecessary furnishing and transforming it into a haphazard vehicle of holy war.

The Hermes is a small, dependable cargo hauler often converted for transport duty among poor frontier worlds. Its crew and passenger facilities are charitably described as ""robust"" but it manages to get the job done with remarkable consistency despite the primitive maintenance facilities it frequents.

Factory-spec, the Hermes is armed only for ""active collision avoidance"", but its turret system is often upgraded to achieve nearly full albeit light point-defense coverage that can destroy the stray missile while escaping from active combat zones. This Luddic Pather modification, however, strips out most of the cargo and crew space and small weapon mounts in favour of a medium hound-scavanged ballistic hardpoint, along with overcharged engines to quickly leap in, strike, and leap out again. While usually manned by the desperate or the mad, some truly legendary Martyrs started their lives as a Hermes captain.",,,
mule_lp_x,SHIP,"This ramshackle vessel is assembled from a Nebula and a Mule by Pathers. With the cargo compartments removed and replaced with weaponry, hull reinforcement, and overtuned engines, this ship is incredibly fast and packs a mighty punch. However it is noticeably fragile, unsurprising given its uneven construction. This however does not deter the most Faithful of the Path who desire a Martyrs death, something this ship is almost guaranteed to give.",,,
phaeton_lp,SHIP,"Fanatics of the Luddic Path have made this ship their own, stripping out all unnecessary furnishing and transforming it into a haphazard vehicle of holy war.

Typically a medium tanker is left a smoking ruin in the wake of the Luddic Path. Sometimes, however, the hulls are stolen away, and completely remade. Now it forms a flexible, if fragile destroyer, able to attack at range with its missile armament, or demolish foes up close with its large ballistic.",,,
starliner_lp_x,SHIP,"Heavily modified by the Luddic Path, this butchered husk of a Starliner has the decadent crew compartments completely striiped out. In their place a hapazard collection of hull reinforcement, weapons, engines and superior flux infrastructure have been sintalled to fight the followers of Moloch. Surprisingly nimble for its size and packed with weaponry, the craft is also fragile in the face of withering fire. A feared vessel, this overtuned cruiser can crush any diabolical vessel smaller than it, but tends to turn its crew into Martyrs when encountering larger enemies.",,,
eagle_le_lp,SHIP,"Almost unrecognisable from the original Eagle, this practically scrapped cruiser has had large portions of the structure removed and replaced with ballistic mounts. While the ship has been drastically down-armoured, the vent management system has been maintained  (albeit poorly), and additional engines have been crudely added. An incredibly dangerous weapon of Holy War (both to its crew and its enemies), this Luddic vessel is blisteringly quick and startlingly resilient.

Eagle-class cruisers are often found at the core of military fleets headed for battle. It is not hard to see why: A strong overall profile, with a robust engine, the Eagle's deadly weapons package is a threat to all enemies.

The Eagle can deliver a strong tactical punch to enemy formations. Its numerous turret and hardpoint emplacements make it very dangerous to smaller foes. Decent armor and a strong shield emitter let it hold space while outnumbered, or even when faced with the rare larger ship. 

These strengths are somewhat countered by strike craft - an Eagle captain must always watch their scopes for an approaching strike squadron, since their ship will be easily crippled by multiple hits from modern strike weapons. 

The embodiment of the sleek and powerful space cruiser from the time of the Domain, the Eagle-class ships are a beautiful reminder of the technological and aesthetic achievements of humanity's past. ",,,
le_prometheus3,SHIP,"The fanatical Pathers have discovered an ironic sense of justice in converting the tanker which carries what they call 'Infernium' - AM fuel - into a hulking implement of holy war. Unlike the Prometheus Mk II. occassionally seen in Luddic Path fleets, this derivative still has most of its pre-existing civilian infrastructure intact. Instead, a makeshift ship factory has been installed in the now cored-out main fuel tank. It is from this drydock that a ramshackle suicide ship laden with explosives can be flown out of to bring the Divine Retribution of the Light of Ludd to the servants of Moloch, granting salvation in complete annhiliation.",,,
lp_dram_missile,SHIP,"A stripped-back Dram hull filled with explosives, this improvised suicide vessel can cripple stations and fleet vessels if it can make contact. However, its ramshackle construction lacks structural stability and the vessel can be disabled by withering firepower.",,,
,,,,,
fasces,SHIP,"An over-armoured artillery vessel, the Fasces is a rare but terrifying vessel born of the same chassis as the Enforcer. Bearing a near-cruiser sized ballistic armament in a destroyer-class vessel, this ship suffers from a poor flux pool and awful mobility.

A sister ship to the Enforcer, the Fasces was produced as a replacement for the Manticore. With a more compact profile, heavy armour and good armament protection, the ship was let down by its awful flux systems based on the original Enforcer. The ship did see widespread production, widely rumoured to be a consequence of backroom graft, which resulted in the Manticore being displaced in core Domain battlegroups - but the ship saw significant push-back by frontier regions.",,,
revolt,SHIP,"The Revolt is a defensive cruiser with a focus on being well protected with armour and armament. Designed to withstand damage and provide local support with its fighter bay, the Revolt lacks the ability to concentrate its firepower.

With light craft seeing an increasing role in rebellion engagements, particularly with mobility to circumvent the typical battle-line doctrine, there was a growing need to provide a vessel that could cover itself and other craft. The result was the Revolt, a ship designed to be suitably covered by firing arcs and thick armour to withstand flanking attacks and fighter strikes. Further, the good arcs enable better coverage of other craft in the battle line, and enable good ability to prevent flanking maneuvers by opposing craft. Nowadays this ship sees extended service as capital escorts, providing good space protection for the venerable Onslaught class.",,,
,,,,,
fidem,SHIP,"A heavy frigate, this vessel can fulfil a number of roles due to its flexible armament, fighter deck bay and ammunition feeder system. However, its logistical profile is often found to be too high for its class, especially when compared with more specialised hulls.

While the Mora was a ubiquitous hull during the Expansion Era of the Domain of Man, the smaller Fidem saw significantly less interest. Based on similar principles, the Fidem was designed to be a rugged, hardy frigate that could fulfill a variety of roles. And for its size, it was able to achieve a vast array of functions, with a combination of flight deck, Accelerated Ammunition Feeder system and flexible missile mounts in a small, heavily armoured package. However, the hull was simply too expensive to maintain when compared with its smaller, cheaper and more specialised competition - the Shepherd. Consequently the vessel fell out of use for centuries until the Church of Galactic Redemption picked up the safely archaic design to lend fighter coverages to smaller patrols.",,,
lector,SHIP,"The Lector is positively archaeological design, still utilising an old Damper Field as its defensive system. With an oversized armament, good speed and decent armour, this vessel shows its age in extended engagements due to its lack of shield generator.

The Lector was a very early chassis designed to provide fire support for flanking maneuvers. With a rather modest (for the time) armament and a system to temporarily boost the reload speed of the ballistics weaponry, this ship could very rapidly capitalise on the vulnerable sides and rear of the enemy battle line. It also saw extensive usage in patrols, as its speed enabled it to catch up to light craft and crush them.

However, the Lector had been designed with the idea that a shield generator could never be produced small enough and efficient enough to be utilised by craft smaller than an orbital station. When such a generator was eventually produced, and installation of it into the Lector was deemed impractical, the craft rapidly fell out of use outside of pirate bands and fringe outposts, and then into memory. The Lector, since being rediscovered, has been picked up by the Church of Galactic Redemption as a fast attack destroyer due to the simplistic technology used in its creation and maintenance, and for its disproportionate speed and armament.",,,
jude,SHIP,"Packing a powerful punch, the Jude is a destroyer with ample armament and a large missile slot. While these features appear attractive on paper, many are often turned away by its disproportionately high logistical cost.

The Jude is an old vessel, designed to provide close missile support in front-line combat. The result was an awkward ship that was too large to be a destroyer, yet it's armament was too undersized for a cruiser. The craft itself was also disproportionally expensive to maintain, and combined with limited maneuverability the ship faded out of widespread usage when tactics began to switch towards the more mobilty-focused Expansion doctrine. The Church of Galactic Redemption has since picked up the technologically inferior design as a solid if expensive artillery vessel.",,,
christopher,SHIP,"A paradoxical heavy light cruiser, the Christopher is a defensive escort vessel. Limited in mobilty and with its strong ballistic armament unable to adequately focus, the Christopher is nevertheless an effective choice for dealing with small targets in battle-line settings, protecting larger craft from flanking frigates and fighters.

The Christopher is an incredibly awkward design by modern conventions. Its size, armament and logistical profile puts it in the light cruiser range, yet it's thick armour and sluggish mobility firmly places it in the heavy cruiser category. In its day it was designed to stand on the battle line to protect other ships and destroy missile and fighter formations while providing missile strike capability. However, in this dual role as armoured anvil and escort gunboat it has long since been supplanted by the Dominator and the Enforcer, respectively. Further, the ship lacks a location within it's reinforced, armoured chassis to install a shield generator, instead relying on an old cannister flak system and its incredibly thick ablative armour for defense. Perhaps it is because of these low tech eccentricities that this archaic design has been adopted by the Church of Galactic Redemption to provide an anchor for smaller fleets.",,,
sebastian,SHIP,"A venerable design, the Sebastian is an oversized cruiser carrier with focused forward-facing ballistic firepower. When combined with its fighter wings this ship can concentrate a lot of ordinance on a single foe, however the vessel is let down by poor mobility and a strenuous logistics profile.

The Sebatian was born of the original Expansion Era battle line doctrine, with a strong focus on ballistic firepower and heavy armour. The vessel was intended to not only provide fighter support, but also stand on its own against the fire of enemy ships. In these key features the Sebastian was outstanding. However, it soon fell victim to its design parameters - it was designed to fly at the same speed as the slower main line vessels, but as doctrines evolved to a more mobility based doctrine, the Sebastian proved simply too slow and too expensive when compared with the newer models, such as the Heron. Its slow speed and high logistical profile rapidly buried the Sebastian as a combat ship as fleet ships became more mobile, but has been picked up by the Church of Galactic Redemption due to the lack of excessively advanced technology. The ship is now an effective  fleet anchor, able to strike at range with fighters while keeping enemies at bay with its firepower.",,,

#Light of Ludd,,,,,
le_dram_w,WEAPON,"The strongest weapon in the Sacred Arsenal against the agents of Moloch, the Divine Light of Ludd is a stripped-back Dram hull loaded with explosives. The lightness and fragility of the improvised ship, combined with the fact that it's loaded with bombs and fuel, means the ship is somewhat fragile. However, the ship-sized missile is fast, and if it makes it within range of its target it can bring annhilitic salvation to stations and capital ships, and even remove cruisers from the void.",,,

#Alexandretta,,,,,
hegemony_hera,CUSTOM,"A remnant of the Alexandretta Polity, this base was forcibly acquired by the Hegemony during the invasion of the Pirate Lord Scarborough in the name of 'protecting the citizens of Alexandretta'. Although the Hegemony leadership has made several promises to vacate the facility and return it to the Alexandretta Polity in the wake of Scarborough's defeat on Cerberus, the station still remains in Hegemony hands, and increasingly it appears that this fact will not change in the future. Understandably, ownership of this station is a sore topic for most Alexandrettans.",,,
luddicchurch_cerebrus,CUSTOM,"The seat of the Alexandretta Polity, this planet was the site of the last battle against the Pirate Lord Scarborough many cycles ago. While the surface of Cerberus was nearly destroyed in the attack, the Alexandrettans were able to fight off the invading pirates. However, the cost of the attack was horrific. Encroaching Hegemony influence in the wake of the assault and the weakness of the now crippled Polity drove the Alexandrettans to turn to the Luddic Church for assistance. The planet is now a somewhat loyal bastion to the Luddic Church, if more out of necessity rather than genuine faith. The remnants of Cerberus' industry now fuels a limited ship building program sanctioned by the Church, further increasing the theological dubiousness of the planet.",,,
planet_artaxerxes,CUSTOM,"When Lord Scarborough initially invaded Alexandretta, the lush alpine planet of Artaxerxes was the first to face his terrible hunger. The meagre first-responding defence force was completely annhiliated, with the fractured remnants driven back to Cerberus, and leaving the populace to the deprivations and horrors of Lord Scarborough. Luckily, the defiance of the populace was able to keep the pirate forces occupied even after grievous retributions by the pirates, enabling stronger defences to muster at Cerberus. Unfortunately the Alexandretta Polity could not liberate the beleaguered populace, hard-pressed as they were to defend themselves. They were forced to watch as Artaxerxes and its populace were burnt in retribution for its defiance, in what is arguably the first usage of starship fuel to achieve complete planetary destruction.",,,

#Bounty Boats,,,,,
onslaught_lc,SHIP,"This vessel was a part of a lend-lease program from the Hegemony to the Church of Galactic Redemption during the First AI War. Since then it has been extensively retrofitted by the Luddic Church, stripping out more complicated technologies and replacing them with more archaic but reliable systems.

A venerable design, the Onslaught-class battleships were first created to serve the Domain Armada long ago, before the development of advanced strike weapons, modern energy weapons, and shield systems. 

When first launched from orbital dock, their firepower and burst-speed surely intimidated entire systems. Some even say that they were built to combat non-humans in a long forgotten war. Much later, Orion Shipyards engineers made modifications to the blueprints to include a shield system, upgraded the hyperdrive, and reduced the required crew complement through automation and iterative engineering. Even though more advanced blueprints are available, the Onslaught remains the easiest to manufacture due to the brutal simplicity of its systems. 

A ship designed without shields in mind, built to be able to withstand a heavy barrage of enemy fire and strike back while protecting its crew is much loved by its officers and crew. And strike back it can; the Onslaught's unmatched ballistic potential can devastate entire fleets in minutes, its only drawback a logistical dependency on ammunition. 

Onslaught crews are proud to serve in the class which forms the backbone of the Hegemony Navy.",,,
legion_lc,SHIP,"This vessel was a part of a lend-lease program from the Hegemony to the Church of Galactic Redemption during the First AI War. Since then it has been extensively retrofitted by the Luddic Church, stripping out more complicated technologies and replacing them with more archaic but reliable systems.

Classified as a battlecarrier, the Legion mounts an impressive array of heavy weapons, hangar-space, and command-control sufficient to field four fighter wings. Later models were upgraded with nanoforges keyed to replacement of fightercraft, significantly increasing tooth-to-tail ratio on distant deployments.

After the legendary success of the Onslaught design it became clear that rebellious systems without ultra-heavy industry were able to develop carrier-based strike-craft capable of countering the 'Old Man' of the Armada. Alongside new weapons - nimble anti-fighter missiles and rapid-tracking point defense cannon - the Strategic Council decided to deploy a carrier worthy of service alongside the Onslaught. Thus the Legion was designed to provide a platform for interceptors and strike-craft while standing on the line of battle. 

Proponents of the 'Cruiser School' criticized the Legion for insufficient specialization, maintaining that similar fighter volume can be fielded at less cost and greater flexibility if combat roles are separated into distinct ship hulls. These economic arguments do pale in the face of an incoming Legion engaging its burn drive to deliver crushing firepower at the key point of battle.",,,
dominator_luddic,SHIP,"This vessel was a part of a lend-lease program from the Hegemony to the Church of Galactic Redemption during the First AI War. Since then it has been extensively retrofitted by the Luddic Church, stripping out more complicated technologies and replacing them with more archaic but reliable systems.

Ponderous and menacing, the Dominator-class is one of the most widespread system defense cruisers in Hegemony space. 

While not the most technologically advanced hull, it relies on a plethora of ballistic hardpoints to accomplish its mission, which is more often than not defending orbital installations and vital points of intra-system trade routes. A poor shield emitter which is difficult to manage and thus, rarely engaged, gives way to an almost impregnable interlocking armor belt system making the Dominator safe from most weapons. Even strike craft cannot overcome the hail of projectiles that can be launched to intercept their payloads. This hull proves that tried and true military engineering is difficult to overcome by new ideas and technologies, especially when in the hands of tough, determined crews and experienced officers.

Dependable, durable, and a constant presence in home space around civilized worlds and outposts, the Dominator is perhaps most hated and feared by pirates and law-breaking corporate agents. ",,,
enforcer_luddic,SHIP,"This vessel was a part of a lend-lease program from the Hegemony to the Church of Galactic Redemption during the First AI War. Since then it has been extensively retrofitted by the Luddic Church, stripping out more complicated technologies and replacing them with more archaic but reliable systems.

The Enforcer-class ships commonly serve in system or convoy defense roles. The design features good armor and multiple ballistic hardpoints, while shield performance is somewhat underwhelming. 

The blueprints of the ship call for many components similar to those found in the Onslaught-class battleships, suggesting that the designs were created during a similar period of military expansion in the Domain. The Enforcer-class features similar no-nonsense weapon system design choices, tough bulkheads, and is well regarded by its crews.

Tough to beat in a destroyer to destroyer fight, the Enforcer rarely takes part in larger battles due to the common view that its low speed makes it a liability. Nonetheless, Hegemony order of battle doctrines mandate an attached Enforcer squadron as a screen for Onslaught-class battleships. The logistical ease with which shared components can be used by both ship types is exactly the type of detail that excites Hegemony logistics bureaucrats.",,,
