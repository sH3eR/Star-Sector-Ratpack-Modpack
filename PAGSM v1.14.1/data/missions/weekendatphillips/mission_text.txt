Location: Sindrian Fuel Company Board of Research and Development Testing Site in the fringe of the Askonia system

In some faraway area, far from the core of the Askonia system, an important occasion is being held. Researcher Yunris Kween, rising star in the Sindrian Fuel Company’s Board of Research and Development, prepares the final checks before her life’s work is put to the test. Before her stands the current military might of the Sindrian Fuel Company’s navy, battle-hardened designs that have served for countless cycles.

Looking over her own designs, a faint smile forms on Kween’s face. She’s gone through the simulations with her ships and refined them over and over again to ensure that her assembled fleet will be up for the challenge. Success here will put her on the fast track to promotion and eclipsing her superiors. Failure?

Kween shakes the thought from her mind. Her fleet must succeed here. Anything less would be a fate worse than death.
