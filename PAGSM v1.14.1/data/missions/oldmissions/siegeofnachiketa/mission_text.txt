Location: The Naraka system, in orbit of Nachiketa
Date: 2??.??.??

At first, the Nachiketa picket fleets assumed that what was approaching the planet was nothing more than another fuel fleet looking to resupply at the local Antimatter facilities. Only once the ships came into visual range did the patrols realize their fatal mistake. Arriving from Sindria, it was clear why the Sindrian Fuel Company had sent a fleet: To steal Nachiketa’s Synchrotron Core.

Scrambling together as many defenders as possible, countless pickets fell to the combined might of the Sindrian Fuel Fleet, the hostile fleet undeterred as it approached the planet. Yet as shuttles were prepared to send down marines to raid the Antimatter production facilities, a single fleet managed to arrive just in time to halt the raid.

Commodore Dawn Stephens of the 98th Nachiketa Flying Detachment rallied the remaining defenders and picket ships, the united force ready to strike back at the attackers and protect Nachiketa at all cost. Victory will ensure the safety of the Hegemony’s Antimatter fuel production. Failure will see the successor of the Domain being struck a crippling blow.

For the Hegemony, for the Domain, for the future of the Sector!
