sindrian_diktat,FACTION,"The Sindrian Fuel Company, more commonly known as Sindrian Fuel, is an Antimatter Fuel company founded in the aftermath of the relatively recent Hegemony military intervention in the Askonia system led by former Hegemony Navy Admiral, Phillip Andrada. After an illustrious career serving the Hegemony for several cycles, Andrada decided to finally pursue his childhood dream: being the best damn gas station manager on this side of the Persean Sector. Unfortunately, the Hegemony did not take kindly to losing one of their best admirals (and quite a large chunk of their naval forces that Andrada was leading at the time) in the Persean sector and has done everything in their power to spread rumors that the Sindrian Fuel Company is nothing more than a front for a brutal military dictatorship.

Despite constant smear campaigns and attempts to discredit the company, Sindrian Fuel has continued to serve the Persean Sector for over twenty cycles. Though competitors try to disprove it, research (paid for by the Sindrian Fuel Company) proves time and time again that Sindrian antimatter fuel is the best in the sector. With their lovable mascot Volturn-y the Volturnian Lobster adored by families across the the system and beyond, the Sindrian Fuel Company stands as a triumph to a man’s desire to be true to himself and pursue his dreams.

planet_sindria,CUSTOM,"Headquarters and namesake for the Sindrian Fuel Company, Sindria is the shining jewel of fuel production in the Askonia system and indeed the Persean Sector as a whole. Millions call the planet home, citizens living in underground hive-cities. Centuries of mining has wormed through the crust of Sindria while recent self-improvement programs have fostered a homegrown base of artisanal heavy industry. Vast energies captured by a series of solar arrays launched from subsurface mass drivers are used to power one of the Sector’s best (as advertised by the Sindrian Fuel Company) AM fuel production facilities where Sindrian antimatter is created via a secretive process and distilled into fullerene shells carefully mixed with hard work and honest labor (as advertised by the Sindrian Fuel Company) into the stable fuel pellets on which the Persean Sector gets its best fuel from. So good is Sindrian Fuel that fleets come from light years away from all the corners of the Persean Sector for the chance to fill their ships with the best damn fuel on this side of the core worlds (as advertised by the Sindrian Fuel Company.)
",,"This world’s battered crust of cyclopean debris criss-crossed by kilometers-deep pits and chasms is bombarded with intense radiation on the day side, so habitats and industrial facilities must be built deep beneath the surface. The population of Sindria is concentrated in a handful of hive-cities, which the Board of Advertisement and Marketing have ensured to remind everyone of how good Sindrian-brand AM-fuel is. Though the Hegemony may paint Sindria having a desperate underclass living beneath those who are lucky enough to have found positions in the state bureaucracy and intelligence services, these are all in fact nothing more than malicious bouts of slander. The wealth of Sindrian Fuel has always ensured that it can take care of the people of Sindria with countless jobs and opportunities of advancement in the company.",
planet_cruor,CUSTOM,"One of the Sindrian Fuel Company’s fuel franchises, Cruor has always had the misfortune of having to compete with its own sister stations within the sector. Neither being the headquarters of the company nor the home of Volturn-y the Volturnian Lobster, Cruor’s local fuel stations nonetheless are still a busy place for when the lines at Sindria grow too long for even the most patient of customers to wait for.",,"The world's crust is squeezed and cracked by the powerful tidal forces of Salus, causing regular quakes and eruptions. Abundant geysers of volatile gasses maintain a thin, toxic atmosphere and combine with iron compounds to give Cruor its sanguine colouration. Tracked rigs roam the more stable surface provinces, ripping out rare or merely convenient ores for export while corroding ruins of machines can occasionally be seen amidst the scars of strip-mining. Though rumors circulate about the conditions of mobile labor camps operated by the company higher ups, all workers are in fact well taken care of and given complimentary vacation days to Volturn. Workers are even given the opportunity to participate in the company lottery to meet Volturn-y the Volturnian Lobster in person!",
planet_volturn,CUSTOM,"Though the Sindrian Fuel Company may be most well known for its Antimatter fuel, it is also famed for its lobsters. Home of the Sindrian Fuel Company’s mascot, Volturn-y the Volturnian Lobster, Volturn is a resort world where the sector goes to dine on the finest (and mind you legally only!) Volturnian Lobster on this side of the Core Worlds. Fished from the crushing depths of Volturn’s world ocean, Volturnian Lobster is a delicacy that fills the various floating markets and restaurants across the planet. The famed Volturnian Lobster Garden, where Volturn-y the Volturnian Lobster calls home, has a waitlist going back over ten cycles as millions eagerly line up for the chance to meet the Sindrian mascot in person.",,"Volturn was envisioned as a planet of agriculture and leisure to service the now annihilated capital city-moon, Opis. Graciously taking in the countless refugees from the Askonia Crisis, the population of Volturn has boomed as opportunities provided by the Sindrian Fuel Company ensure the livelihood of countless families. Home of the (100% copyrighted by the Sindrian Fuel Company) Volturnian Lobster, massive fisheries operate to ensure a steady supply of lobsters to both the local markets and restaurants as well as to far off stations across the Askonian system and beyond. Please don’t be dissuaded by the rumors of resistance movements, cults and criminal syndicates operating on the surface of Volturn. That’d make Volturn-y the Volturnian Lobster, beloved mascot of the Sindrian Fuel Company, sad.",
planet_umbra,CUSTOM,"Headquarters of the Askonian Refueling Consortium, a local faction of Antis. Work conditions are unforgiving as hard deadlines are pressed to compete with the sector famed Sindrian-brand antimatter fuel. Corners are cut as the planet’s volatiles are mined and shipped off to be made into subpar (as advertised by the Sindrian Fuel Company) antimatter fuel. The ARC has also allowed what might be termed as “pirates” to operate from Umbra, in an attempt to disrupt Sindrian fuel shipments across the various gas station franchises.",,"Far from Askonia's primary, Umbra is a frozen world of methane and ammonia where water-ice is like rock and may be found in mountainous outcroppings and boulders. A thin atmosphere of volatiles is formed on the starward side of the planet only to freeze again on the dark side. Most craters are filled in over time as this ""snow"" is deposited. There is some mining of heavier materials from the poor, rocky mantle buried many kilometers beneath the glacial crust. Habitats are burrowed deeply; life on Umbra is harsh and few would willingly choose to live here permanently. A trickle of out-of-system Sindrian Fuel competitors still brings much-needed supplies and the hope of one day outshining Sindrian antimatter fuel.",
planet_nachiketa,CUSTOM,"This world was selected by Domain bureaucrats as a site for one of the Sector's AM fuel production facilities due to having no outstanding value apart from existing on a convenient axis of expansion into further frontiers. Industry and port facilities followed the fuel facility's boost to starship traffic, growing like barnacles from the massive armored and half-buried fuel plant. A major confrontation during the First AI War saw these surrounding port facilities devastated due to a tactical purge of AM reserves; the Hegemony secured victory, but crippled the industry and infrastructure of Nachiketa. After the devastation of the First AI War, a consortium of military officers and industrial magnates purchased a controlling stake in the AM fuel plant. The Nachiketa consortium, christened Nachiketa Fuel Traders Incorporated, now possesses a complete monopoly on AM fuel production within the Hegemony and is a major producer of vital starfuel in the sector, only second to the Sindrian Fuel Company -- a fact that causes the board of directors no lack of annoyance.",,"Nachiketa Fuel Traders Incorporated, NFT, Inc for short, was founded to help strengthen the local supply of AM-fuel for the fleets of the Hegemony. What started as a single AM production plant on Nachiketa has grown into a vast support network of various chains and supply lines spanning the entirety of Hegemony space. Purchasing various rival chains and corporations, NFT, Inc. has grown to control almost everything AM-fuel related within the Hegemony, with the corporation ensuring that the naval forces of the Hegemony have enough fuel to keep their starships running.",
station_sindria_sindrian_fuel,CUSTOM,"Main Franchise Station for the Sindrian Fuel Company, countless fleets arrive daily to refuel their starships. Arriving from far and wide across the Core Worlds and beyond, lines are reportedly very long indeed.",,,

# SFC Fleet,,,,,
# Civilian Tankers,,,,,
pinkdram,SHIP,"A light tanker with enough fuel capacity to more than double the effective range of a small task force or convoy. This version is colored in the livery of the Sindrian Fuel Company, and even includes built-in solar shielding.",,,
pinkphaeton,SHIP,"A medium tanker with enough fuel capacity to support a larger fleet. Tanker duty is often considered the greatest service in the Sindrian Fuel Company - company employees are willing to give their life to ensure the safe delivery of Sindrian brand AM-fuel across the Persean sector. This version is colored in the livery of the Sindrian Fuel Company, and even includes built-in solar shielding.",,,
pinkprometheus,SHIP,"A tanker of vast capacity used to shift strategic quantities of fuel between worlds. Unlike its smaller cousins, the Prometheus features a reasonable defensive arsenal to protect its valuable and volatile cargo. This version is colored in the livery of the Sindrian Fuel Company, and even includes built-in solar shielding.",,,
pinkmarathon,SHIP,"An enormous tanker built more for transporting vast quantities of antimatter fuel to fuel depots and refueling stations than for supplying a fleet, the Marathon is nonetheless capable of vastly increasing a fleet's range across the sector. Provided one doesn't mind crawling across hyperspace due to the lumbering nature of the Marathon. This version is colored in the livery of the Sindrian Fuel Company, and even includes built-in solar shielding.

The Marathon, despite its initial appearances, is more appropriately two ships connected together by a framework. The main area which the crew operates from is essentially a separate ship latched onto a massive fuel tanker. Due to the vast nature of the ship overall, a proper shield system is usually foregone for modular shield emitters on the sides. Considering the volatile nature of antimatter, a Marathon caught in an engagement is a vulnerable target that can barely protect itself.",,,
,,,,,
# Original Military Tankers,,,,,
sfcdram,SHIP,"One of the iconic warships of the Sindrian Fuel Company, the Dram DM-150 is a durable destroyer capable of shrugging off an entire fleet's worth of firepower and come out no worse for wear. Fitted with a modified damper field that allows the DM-150 to continue firing while in use, this destroyer is a common sight among the various militarized fuel fleets of Sindrian Fuel.

""Dependable. Tough. Reliable. Built to last. The Dram DM-150 is the pinnacle of the hard work the Sindrian Fuel Company has put into providing the best for its fuel fleet. With more torque, more power, and a damper field capable of withstanding anything some opportunistic outlaw might throw your way, this Dram is a tough nut to crack. Whether you’re an entrepreneurial captain looking to supply the core worlds with Sindrian brand Antimatter fuel or out solar diving in the outer reaches of the sector, it’ll get you where you need to go.

The Dram DM-150. It can handle anything. Get yours at your local Sindrian Fuel Company Franchise Station today."" - Sindrian Fuel Company advertisment",,,
sfcphaeton,SHIP,"A standard cruiser used by the Sindrian Fuel Company, the Phaeton PN-1500 provides long range support with both its dedicated Akon elite drone wing and large ballistics hardpoint. A system of turret augmenters allows the PN-1500 to lay down whittling fire against the opposition, letting this cruiser strike any unfortunate target with a powerful kinetic barrage.

The Phaeton PN-1500 took several iterations to become the mainstay it is today in the Sindrian Fuel Company. From the humble base hull, the PN-1500 was looked over by multiple design boards for its conversion. Though the Company tends to dissaude fighter usage in its fleet, countless fleet trials was enough to convince the designers to include an integrated drone bay capable of supporting an Akon wing.",,,
sfcprometheus,SHIP,"Built from the Prometheus supertanker design, the Prometheus PM-15000 is a mix of powerful firepower and support through its fighter wings. Both heavily armored and heavily armed, the PM-15000 manages to be a common sight within the Sindrian Fuel Company despite its heavy use of fighters.

The brainchild of Head Researcher Yunris Kween, the Prometheus PM-15000 is considered the Sindrian Fuel Company's answer to the Hegemony's vaunted Legion battlecarrier. Taking advantage of the sheer bulk of the base Prometheus supertanker, the PM-15000 is a heavily upgunned and uparmored civilian-retrofit capable of both taking punishment and dishing it out while still allowing it to maintain its role as a fleet refueler. With a dedicated fighter bay for a Minim-class Antimatter bomber, this battlecarrier is the pinnacle of the hard work and honest labor policy that the Sindrian Fuel Company champions itself for.

Any resemblance to the Luddic Path's own Prometheus conversion are merely coincidental. The Sindrian Fuel Company would never stoop so low as to steal an idea from a radical group of Volturn-y hating, fuel abusing fanatics.",,,
,,,,,
# New Military Tankers,,,,,
sfccoeus,SHIP,"A light patrol frigate also capable of handling tanker duties, the Coeus CS-50 is mainly used to help maintaining security and protecting Sindrian Fuel franchise stations from jealous rivals and opportunistic outlaws. Though lightly armed, the CS-50 can easily be pressed into more active military duties as need be.",,,
sfcpolus,SHIP,"Designed to operate as a devastating torpedo boat, the Polus PS-50 has a dedicated loading system that allows it to rapidly deploy new missiles at a moment's notice.

Rumors of the untrustworthiness of crews stationed on PS-50s are nothing more than hearsay and slander.",,,
sfcslent,SHIP,"The Slent ST-50 is a standard tanker frigate utilized by the Sindrian Fuel Company for its various fuel fleets. A rather unimposing design, the ST-50 nonetheless provides plenty of options for fleet commanders to take advantage of. Including a missile autoforge system to help keep its missile stores topped up during longer engagements, the ST-50 is a reliable frigate capable of filling the gaps in many fleet compositions.",,,
sfcpolybolos,SHIP,"A ballistics focused frigate, the Polybolos PB-50 is based on the small tanker design of the Firecracker. Capable of temporarily extending its range, the PB-50 is designed to provide a ballistics punch to the Sindrian Fuel Company.",,,
sfcporpax,SHIP,"A defense oriented frigate, the Porpax PX-50's main strength comes from its ability to strengthen its shield at a moment's notice. Utilizing a blend of premium grade antimatter fuel, the PX-50's shield can temporarily withstand even the most toughest of attacks.",,,
sfctalaria,SHIP,"A devastating (and some might say inefficient) warship, the Talaria TA-50 represents the ingenuity of the Sindrian Fuel Company's Board of Research. Spearheaded by Lead Developer Gregory Mannfred, The TA-50 takes advantage of its AM-storage tanks to power its built-in Anitmatter blaster. Through tweaking, the Sindrian Fuel Company has managed to rework the powerful weapon to be useful in protracted engagements. Though some damage potential has been lost to ensure the longevity of the weapon, the TA-50 nonetheless is a cutting edge frigate capable of punching well above its weight.",,,
sfckobalos,SHIP,"A nimble and agile phase ship developed by the Board of Research and Development, the Kobalos KS-50 can sneakily move around the battlefield and destabilize enemy ships .",,,
sfchydria,SHIP,"A well-armed phase ship, the Hydria HA-150 is an agile warship capable of sneaking behind enemy lines and delivering a devastating blow to a hostile fleet. Capable of deploying an array of destabilized Plus-grade Fuel Canisters to disrupt fleet lines, the HA-150 is a dangerous vessel capable of swaying the tide of battle through crippling strikes.

Developed by Head Researcher Yunris Kween, the Hydria HA-150 was created to provide the Sindrian Fuel Fleet with a powerful disruptive force against hostile fleets. Envisioned as being able to sneak in, disable a high value target, and get out before being noticed, the HA-150 went through several design changes before finally reaching its completed state. Rumors abound about the vessel's capability of transporting deadlier ordnance, with the Sindrian Fuel Company officially dismissing such rumors as nothing more than 'slander spread by bitter rivals.'",,,
sfcdrachm,SHIP,"Looking to fill out the roles of the the Sindrian Fuel Fleet, the Drachm DH-150 is a missile-focused Destroyer built around providing a barrage of firepower against enemies at a moment's notice. Considered an in-between of the Dram DM-150 and the P-1500, the DH-150 stands tall in providing a whittling array of firepower against hostile elements.",,,
sfctahlanbento,SHIP,"A modification of the Bento design, the Bento BO-150 trades its drone bay to house the infrastructure needed to mount a heavier energy weapon. With systems tuned to provide temporary increased energy weapons output, the BO-150 provides a niche role of assisting its larger counterparts in combat.",,,
sfcdelos,SHIP,"The Delos DS-150 is a Sindrian Fuel overhaul of a rarely seen freighter design used to transport dangerous or exotic materials. Though Antimatter Fuel itself may be quite a dangerous and exotic material, the Board of Research and Development appropriated the design for its own purposes. With additional mounts providing extra firepower and a dedicated drone wing for additional protection while away from the core worlds, the DS-150 is a workhorse to keep researchers safe. Still, the DS-150 is not a proper warship and should not be pressed into a combat role unless absolutely necessary.",,,
sfcbia,SHIP,"The Bia BA-150 is an agile tanker destroyer built for hunting down lone targets and getting away before enemy reinforcements arrive. Capable of keeping up with even some frigates, the BA-150 is prime for taking down enterprising outlaws or jealous rivals trying to sneak in some hits on the slower moving vessels of the fuel fleet.",,,
sfclelantus,SHIP,"The Lelantus LT-150 is a dual-workhorse of a ship, tasked with the dangerous job of both ship dislodging and ship tugging. With its rugged engines and antimatter treated plough, the LT-150 is capable of pushing and pulling well above its weight.",,,
sfckander,SHIP,"A ballistics focused destroyer, the Kander KR-150 operates on providing overwhelming firepower support.",,,
sfcphoronis,SHIP,"A destroyer built for energy weapons, the Phoronis PH-150 is a nimble ship capable of flanking thanks to its phase skimmer system. With its energy weapons pointing in one direction, and synergy weapons pointed in another, the PH-150 is a ship for those willing to get creative with their loadouts.",,,
sfccrius,SHIP,"A powerful workhorse of a warship, the Crius CR-1500 brings to bear a massive amount of energy-based firepower against its enemies. Designed to get into the thick of a fight and come out unscathed, the CR-1500 has both the hull strength and armor to take multiple devastating hits and keep on going.",,,
sfcarke,SHIP,"An oddity amongst the Sindrian Fuel Fleet, the Arke AE-1500 is mainly used as an advertisement ship, utilizing its fighter wings in various events and activities to help promote the Sindrian Fuel Company. Yet when needed, the AE-1500 can easily be made to operate as an, albeit rather underwhelming, escort carrier. It nonetheless has plenty of firepower to keep itself safe and assist other ships.",,,
sfcclepsydra,SHIP,"Built off of an old pre-Collapse design, the Clepsydra CA-1500 is a sturdy ship utilized by the Sindrian Fuel Company for various salvaging purposes. With an enlarged flight deck, the CA-1500 is capable of launching the Slent ST-25 Corvette Bomber to support it.",,,
sfcstymphalia,SHIP,"An infamous addition to the Sindrian Fuel Fleet, the Stymphalia SA-1500 is a persistent warship capable of launching a barrage of missiles. With an onboard missile forge capable of forging new missiles in combat, the SA-1500 rarely ends a fight with empty missile stocks.",,,
sfcaetos,SHIP,"The Aetos AS-1500 is a compartively more agile warship compared to other Company cruisers. With plenty of forward focused firepower, the AS-1500 may falter against a group of smaller vessels due to its lackluster amount of acceptable point defense mounts.",,,
sfcskyrend,SHIP,"The Notos NS-15000 is a completely original design not plagiarized in any way or form whatsoever. Developed by Sindrian Fuel’s Lead Developer Gregory Mannfred, this wholly unique Supertanker Battlecruiser has not at all infringed on any possible copyright laws at all. Its novel twin spinal mounts ensure plenty of frontal firepower can be delivered either through whittling missile fire or via unyielding energy weaponry.

Now please stop trying to compare it to any other sort of designs that may exist. The NS-15000 is a special ship that cannot be replicated by anyone else at all.
",,,
sfcmenoetius,SHIP,"The Menoetius MS-15000 is a dedicated Command Ship used by fuel fleet commanders to direct the flow of battle from a lofty perch. With a suite of support options, the MS-15000 can assist in both fleet actions and ground actions with an array of possibilities. A dedicated fleet barracks as well ensures plenty of room for crew and marines for various operations. With plenty of point defense coverage and fighter wing capacity, this Command Ship can provide a fleet with plenty of options to keep the tide of battle favorable.

Developed under the scrutiny of the Board of Security and Armament, the Menoetius MS-15000 was carefully micromanaged at every step of the way. Originally envisioned as a fast battlecruiser, the success of the Notos NS-15000 design (which is totally not a stolen design!) saw the MS-15000 retooled for different operations. With ""comments"" from various ship board crew in regards to less than favorable living quarters on the various fleet ships, the MS-15000 was modified to allow for an improve level of crew amenities. With proper barracks facilities and even dedicated common rooms, the ship was designed to ensure that crew morale was paramount with keeping ship operations working at peak efficiency.

Due to the increased focus on crew, the Board of Security saw the opportunity to have a ship fit the vital role of dedicated command. Adding modifications and suites to improve the ship's capability of improving fleet performance, the MS-15000 saw its niche carved further into the Fuel Fleet. Though the designers were resistant at first, the addition of Fighter Bays came down to the importance of providing the ship additional capabilities beyond simply leading fleet. Though still comparatively expensive for less dedicated firepower, the MS-15000 has nonetheless found itself an important, if niche, role in the Sindrian Fuel Fleet.",,,
sfcatlas,SHIP,"Transforming the humble cargo hauler into a deadly weapon of war, the Atlas AS-15000 is a major conversion effort by the Sindrian Fuel Company. Though still a relatively fragile ship for its class, the AS-15000 makes up for this with its capability of providing devastating missile fire. Providing heavy, long-range support, the AS-15000 can remain in the backline and still provide vital support for the rest of the fleet.",,,
sfcepimetheus,SHIP,"A slow, ponderous, lumbering beast of a ship, the Epimetheus EM-15000 is a highly armored siege ship built for cracking tough defensive lines. Armed with a powerful (and somewhat impractical) Antimatter Cannon, the EM-15000 is capable of knocking out targets from extreme ranges - provided it is given the time to aim and fire.

The Epimetheus EM-15000 was a ship designed by the Executive Manager of the Board of Research and Development. Considered a vanity project by the majority of the Senior Managers, the ship was nonetheless worked on begrudgingly. Built for extreme survivability first and foremost, the EM-15000 was heavily tuned to be able to shrug off the worst that the Persean Sector has to offer and still keep on going. Despite the lumbering speed of the finished product, an experimental Antimatter Engine and powerful fuel injector provide the ship with the ability to have some hope of keeping up with the rest of the fleet.
",,,
sfciapetus,SHIP,"A design project spearheaded by Head Researcher Yunris Kween, the Iapetus IS-15000 began as a design commission to build an alternative to the ubiquitous Prometheus Supertanker. What would eventually become the IS-15000 went through various iterations, with the project several times going well beyond the original design parameters through radical changes once it received Kween’s full attention. After scaling down the most feasible prototype, the IS-15000 Supertanker Battleship is a powerful warship focused on providing supporting firepower for a fleet.

What information remains of the original prototype is scarce, with rumors abound that the prototype battleship has last been seen collecting dust in some secret facility in Sindria.",,,
sfcsuperiapetus,SHIP,"The original design spec for what would become the Iapetus IS-15000, the Iapetus IS-20000 is much larger than its derivative design. With a complement of fighter bays to add to its protection and ability to aim all its large forward mounts at a single target, the IS-20000 is a heavily armored, well protected, and expensive Dreadnought that has never seen proper adoption into a naval fleet.

Starting off as a design commissioned by a faction looking for an alternative to the ubiquitous Prometheus fuel tanker, the Sindrian Fuel Company graciously accepted the contract. Given only a basic request to make it comparatively more armored than the average tanker, the design began simple enough. It was only once Head Researcher Yunris Kween became involved did the project begin to run into trouble.

Dubbing the development process “Project Selkie”, Head Researcher Kween took the current design blueprints and worked on adapting it to military applications. Borrowing cues from other warships in the Sindrian Fuel Fleet line-up, what should have started and ended as an armored tanker warped into something else entirely. Many modifications were added, from fighter bays, weapon mounts for where fuel storage should be placed, to even an experimental Antimatter engine. The ambitious project soon went far beyond the original faction’s request, and the original projected budget as well.

After the final systems were put into place, the last bits of hull completed, and ship amenities properly installed, the ship that would be dubbed the Iapetus IS-20000 was deemed too impractical for formal adoption to the Sindrian Fuel Fleet. Only after scaling down the design to a somewhat more manageable level was a derivative design considered for addition to the fleet, and even then at a very limited capacity. The whereabouts of the original ship is still a mystery, with most rumors pointing it to simply collecting dust in an underused dry dock, left to sit around and do nothing.

Equipped with a gargantuan Gigacannon and extreme forward-based firepower, this massive showpiece of the Lion's Guard power is nonetheless made for being a showy center of any battle it partakes in.

Born out of a desire for a showpiece of the Lion's Guard's supremacy in the politics of Askonia, the Murmidon Heavy Assault Mech was developed first and foremost as a weapon of awe and inspiration. With a vast budget and zero oversight, the project was consistently at odds with any practical considerations. With development eating into other departments, the end result was a towering symbol of excess and grandeur. No expense was spare for both exterior and interior, with the command center of the giant mech furnished with posh amenities more appropraite in a palacial estate than on the battlefield. The main gun of the Murmidon was equally spared considerations of practicality. Barely capable of being fielded on a proper battleship, the gargantuan Gigacannon's impressive capacity for destruction underplays the strain it puts on the Murmidon's engines.

de_flurry,SHIP,"Despite general regulation of fighter development ever since Andrada decreed focused away from such projects, the Sindrian Fuel Company still does have some development of fighters. These projects operate on a more ""low-key"" level, receiving less attention and funding from the Supreme Chief Overlord President Executive Gas Station Manager Andrada. As such, such projects often fall short of more tried and true designs.

The Flurry was the brainchild of a minor fuel fleet admiral whose only distinctive features was his downright cult-like obsession over Squalls, claiming that they were the ""one true missiles"" and that ""sabots can eat my burn"". To that point, he attempted to make an entire bomber focused solely around the Squall, which understandably did not go down well with most fighter development branches. Only through private funding secured by bored investors did the project manage to do more than collect dust as a blueprint.

The Flurry's development was littered with structural issues and deficits, mostly corresponding to the large size of the Squall payload in comparison to the ship, reducing size for armour or engines. The half-hearted solutions to these problems resulted in the Flurry having an abysmal top speed and thin armour/hull plating for a fighter of its calibre. Another difficulty was the inefficiency of the Squall missiles on the payload; their unique arming system often meant they were shot down as soon as they were fired, or would find(and miss) targets completely separate from the bomber's target. These inefficiencies, coupled with the admiral's insistence on using pure Squalls, lead to the project being denied and stonewalled from mass production.

A new team was eventually appointed to head the Flurry's development, which extensively modified the Squalls used in the Flurry to better serve its purpose. Ironically, they were changed so drastically from the base model that the original admiral who initiated the project quit it out of rage that his beloved Squalls were being tainted. Regardless, the end product was deemed decent enough to be officially put into the Company's roster; even if only to reduce its reliance on exported models of fighters.",,,
de_bretasinge,SHIP,"Despite general regulation of fighter development ever since Andrada decreed focused away from such projects, the Sindrian Fuel Company still does have some development of fighters. These projects operate on a more ""low-key"" level, receiving less attention and funding from the Supreme Chief Overlord President Executive Gas Station Manager Andrada. As such, such projects often fall short of more tried and true designs.

The Bretasinge was born of a noble, yet shortsighted idea; the idea to strap a dual flak turret to a large fighter to make it the ultimate point defense fighter. However, this idea soon fell flat when confronted with reality; the Bretasinge's development, like the Flurry's, was riddled with issues, mostly born out of constraints of space. Rather unfortunately, the reactor, engine and coolant systems among others required to maintain a medium flak turret requires a ship at least at frigate size, yet the leads refused to give in and powered through, fixing these glaring issues with ever more haphazardous bandaid solutions, such as removing armour plating to increase speed, removing unecessary components, replacing a human crew with a Delta-class AI core and more.

The resulting fighter was massive; barely managing to get into the corvette weight class and hence LPC rights. Despite this, much of its armour plating is slipshod and weak, with many integral parts even exposed to space, making it much weaker than its size might imply. The removal of ""unecessary systems"" led to the Bretasinge losing its shield generator, and the usage of cheap, inefficient components to compensate for underfunding led to its turret suffering from permanent deficits in its function. Its large size(and tendency to overheat in bays) has also made it a logistical nightmare to use. Its only real advantage is the sheer efficiency at which a dual flak turret shreds through any missile or fighter coming at it.

Ironically enough, the Bretasinge got its name from two tangents; One regarding how one of the leads was an enthusiast in old Earth cultures, and one regarding its tendency to singe anyone who touched it due to its lack of a proper cooling system.",,,
de_bretais,SHIP,"Despite general regulation of fighter development ever since Andrada decreed focused away from such projects, the Sindrian Fuel Company still does have some development of fighters. These projects operate on a more ""low-key"" level, receiving less attention and funding from the Supreme Chief Overlord President Executive Gas Station Manager Andrada. As such, such projects often fall short of more tried and true designs.

After the failure of the Bretasinge, the team that created it set out to right their wrongs by creating an actually viable fighter design. Against the protest of many higher ups and through much grueling effort fighting bureacratic bloat, they finally managed to get a second warrant to create another fighter; though under the threat of losing out on participating in the monthly company lottery if they failed again. With the stakes higher than ever before, they got to work quickly.

In a twist of fate, the Bretais' development went through surprisingly smoothly; downsizing the size of the Bretasinge chassis and its mount allowed for far more leeway for appropriate systems, meaning it could be outfitted to a far more reasonable standard. Usage of more efficient high-tech engines allowed for more space for shielding, armour and even specialized point defense systems to be installed on the chassis. Including a proper cooling system; that way it would no longer singe anyone who put their hands on it.

The result was a surprisingly efficient and logistically cheap support fighter, suitable for use as a mobile flying Vulcan turret while not sacrificing on every other aspect of its construction like the Bretasinge. To date, it is the most successful design to come from the Company's engineers, with it proudly being flown on many a carrier in Company fleets.",,,
