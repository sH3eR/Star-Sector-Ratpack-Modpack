Passing through the main entrance into the underground proper, your shuttle drifts past the main areas of the underground city, passing by countless underground habitation arcologies and industrial centers.

It even looks like it hasn't been touched by the Board of Advertisement and Marketing. Reaching one of the landing pads, you see someone already waiting for you.

""Nice, isn't it?"" Mannfred remarks as he guides you up a flight of stairs and down a row of similar looking apartment doors. ""Almost makes you think you're not living several thousands of feet below ground. Ah, here we are, my home!""

Stopping in front of a door, Mannfred taps his ID against the touchpad, a light beep causing the door to slowly open up. ""Come inside, make yourself at home, I'll get us some drinks!""

Stepping inside, you find Mannfred's home to be rather well furnished, if somewhat utilitarian in design. You quickly take a seat on one of the stools next to a kitchen counter top as Mannfred returns with a bottle and a pair of drinking glasses.
