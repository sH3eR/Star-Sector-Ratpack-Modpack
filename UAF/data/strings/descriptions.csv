uaf_m_seiichi,SHIP,"Seiichi was a class of destroyers designed and built by the former Ceyaian Space Engineering Bureau No. 196, now merged into a multi-national coalition of manufacturing companies under the leadership of a corporation known as Armok Industries. They used to serve during the Battle of Aurora before being ultimately phased out by the jack-of-all-trades, the Nakiha class Frigate Leader.

With the outbreak of the war, the ship was hastily brought up to service in order to fill in the desperately needed role as a heavy hitter - something the first generation frigates aren't capable of due to their lightweight design. Its heavy armor and armament proved to be invaluable as they allowed her to engage and stay in the fight much longer alongside the battlecruisers. By the time the navy gathered enough experience to introduce second generation ships, the outdated Seiichi have shown its age and downgraded to secondary roles until the present day.

The Vaharagiri is the brand new answer to a popular demand for a hybrid support ship. 

She was actually a major modification of another prototype destroyer, the Super Nakiha as she borrowed several features from her which resulted in more power and increased operating range. The main difference between the Vaharagiri and the rest of the upcoming destroyer series are her main weapon mounts which can support all kind of weaponry as a future-proof design. However, such advanced features consumed most of the internal space and added a ton of weight upon the hull. This was made possible only due to major compromises in terms of armor protection and overall structural integrity which should be neglectable so long as the shield is still active.

Its increased size allows more room for improvement such as advanced internal upgrade, high performance cruiser-grade engines supported by an even more powerful power plant.

It used to be a common sight to see these shuttles travelling between places, and now it shall prosper once more with brand new upgrades and paint jobs.

Nicknamed the 'Warrior', it can indeed fight back even for a shuttle standard but only to a certain extent. A wise captain would choose to fight alongside escorts rather than lone wolfing especially against well-armed enemies. However if used correctly, it can also provide distraction by diving into the enemy flanks and disengage just as quickly thanks to its high speed and maneuverability. Its dual missile hardpoints would prove useful to strike where it hurts the most. Unfortunately, it was only brought up to military service only and generally not available in a typical navy standard variant which made it quite a rare ship.

 The Fusoreina was designed as the stopgap solution to such capital problem. She is equipped with super-heavy armor plating and forward facing weaponry along with reverse-engineered armor enhancing damper technology, ripped from the carcass of a former capital warship. These upgrades will ensure longevity and survivability to the absolute limit but eventually proven to be too costly of an investment for the Navy. Another interesting fact is the ship was manufactured by the Armok Military Industries and Technologies, one of the very few manufacturers whom dared to cross into the unknown along with the Permaisuri's expedition. She was given the honor to be named after a deceased old friend, one of the founding CEO whom were unfortunate to be in a wrong place at the wrong time. He believed that this ship would serve well to the Permaisuri's cause and protect as many people as possible.

 Despite Reisen II's successful integration into the capital formation, Fusoreina quickly gained popularity among captains and admirals alike. It was simple, yet deadly. The Armok Industries was once again commissioned to design a new revolutionary design that both respects the old design while bringing something new to the table. That's how Fusoreina II was made, now a battle proven warship with flawless service record with countless veterans preferring it over Reisen or even the venerable Rillaru.

 This rare ship is part of the 'Prototypes' that are accepted into limited service of the Auroran Federation Navy.

The plan was to ensure that a fleet would benefit from having a battleship and aircraft carrier from a single capital ship. A large deck was installed on the rear part of the ship, while the frontal prong hulls would have all size of ballistic weaponry. Such design would be fitting of the term, 'glass cannon' as this ship is the jack of all trades, the master of none.

uaf_lyora_prototype,SHIP,"Developed post arrival to the sector, the prototype destroyer is a highly specialized fleet disruption vessel. While she lacks direct firepower, its presence can be felt in any large fleet engagement. This is due to its signature weapon system, codename ""The Lion's Roar"" due to its signature explosive properties. It was developed in response to the exotic technologies witnessed within the Persean Sector. What resists destruction from tactical breve strikes and copius saturation of projectiles, should be made reluctant to do so.

The Lyora is designed to break formations in large fleet engagements with its main armament. The large projectile is reinforced with heavy armor to carry its volatile payload into an enemy formation. The contents of this payload are rumored to be a weaponized by-product of a classified Auroran research. Detonation of the payload forms an extremely brief and unstable sigularity, knocking out ship systems and pulling surrounding objects in. Following the implosion, a concussive blast scatters whatever mass has been collected. While absolutely devestating to a tight formation given the likely chance of violent collision, the Lion's Roar is somewhat ineffective at dealing with singular vessels as it lacks significant explosive power like its more potent cousin, Semibreve. The reinforced armor necessitates an enlarged engine that lacks the fine gimbal of a typical anti-ship missile. Therefore, the Lyora captain should take into account the inertia of their vessel before firing the Lion's Roar. Field tests have determined that proficient usage of the weapon is difficult for an untrained captain, and sufficient caution should be used in deployment. 

She followed a remarkably tempestuous development cycle. After the massive Auroran naval armor refurbishment and reclassification, several vessels had their classes updated to better reflect their roles within the fleet. Afterwards, the Auroran Navy found themselves without a single ship classified as a destroyer. Low ranking officials within the navy bantered that they'd never have a proper destroyer before they were all back on Aurora. Undeterred by jests, development of the Lyora demonstrated the resiliance of the Auroran engineering teams assigned to the project. When design parameters became erratic, the fabled Armok Industrial and Manufacturing (AIM) was called in to help finalize the blueprint. Despite the turbulent development, and limited production due to prototype design costs, she has become the first destroyer class vessel within the newly re-organized Auroran Federation Navy.

It was developed as part of the secretive naval supercapital project, a plan to carry the exploration force far into the Sector and maybe even beyond.

Although it is by all means a combat ship, its secondary purpose is to also accompany an exploration fleet deep into the Sector. ""Expect the unexpected,"" they say. Her frontal firepower isn’t just for show either, she will bite anyone who dares to threaten.

She is the first of the Auroran supercapital trinity to be drafted and constructed, just in time to join the first and bold few who dared to sail blindly into the unknown. 

The Solvernia posesses an unholy combination of immense firepower and impenetrable defenses that can only be powered by the most powerful Melody nuclear fusion reactor possible under Auroran science. The signature ""dazzle"" camouflage pattern not only confuses enemies but also intimidates many against entering her sphere of influence. Meant to be seen by any and all, she needn't ever hide; only the bravest, or perhaps foolish, navy admiral with the mightiest armada behind him would dare to challenge her.

She is the crown jewel and mastermind of the Auroran prototype trinity, currently commissioned as a flagship type for the autonomous sub-faction of the United Aurora Federation: the Auroran Automata Expeditionary Division.

Contrary to expectations given their roles, she is significantly larger than her twin sister. Her lack of direct firepower is made up by a staggering twelve total figher bays for maximum power projection, thanks to her massive twin forward hulls capable of housing small destroyers on their own. She is also equipped with the most advanced, and capitally classified, communications and surveillance technology, able to be used simultaneously for omniscient military surveillance and extensive space exploration objectives.

Needless to say, the Novaeria is both a military titan and a diplomatic paragon; The perfect tool to radiate Auroran influence over any horizon, as her star-silencing presence is deafening from the fringe of hyperspace, sending messages unempeded by causality. Everything will be sorted out and identified, or removed from existence for trying not to be.

Rather than ""go big or go home"", the design behind the Cherry Vanguard was ""go big, or never make it back home."" While designed for maximum cargo capacity on paper, much of the space was actually used for a colossal amount experimental flux capacitors, simply dubbed flux batteries, meant to shield the rest of the cargo and crew from the hyperdimensional effects of storms that, at least in theory, raged with the combined energy of entire civilizations. Although the Cherry Vanguard is lightly armed, but even a hundred battleships are the absolute lease of her worries as it always have been the safety of her crew, and the dark unknown space between the first and final destination that concerns her the most.

For a long period of time after arriving into the Sector far from the Core Worlds Region, the hyper freighter served as a mobile makeshift home port by the expeditionary fleet. She spent her time venturing from one point of the outer reaches of Persean Sector to another under the watchful eyes of the Solvernia. Rumors among spacefarers stated that the United Aurora Federation are already present in the Sector at least for several years before 206 Cycle, but no one could confirm it as no one would believe the Aurorans came from alternate dimensions and many symphatizers sworn to keep their presence a secret. Many would also believe the Aurorans are actually friendly under the leadership of Aeria Charlotte. All they needed to do is to lower down their arms and offer a hand shake first, in return the queen shall bless them with a warm smile and give them exclusive access to re-arm and re-supply with them despite their differences.

It is truly a significant accomplishment for the Federation to even construct this behemoth of a freighter ship in such a short time, only the Queen herself was able to rally this much manpower and resources to construct all three super capital without exhausting the global resources. Many activists and economists once warned and predicted this freighter alone could potentially bankcrupt a colony's economy several times over, but everyone basically either has come to terms or realize the importance of this leviathan as it undeniably allowed the expedition to survive in the Sector long enough for them to finally found a temporary place to call home, they called it the New Aurora which was named after the homeworld they once left some time ago.

Hence why the Roria Esvernia was created in order to combat them when overwhelming firepower seemed to be the only viable option, as fighter supremacy was ineffective against them.

Originally designed as an experimental battleship project for the Automata Expeditionary Division, this super capital warship met the November doctrine of ""Overwhelming Superior Firepower"" while providing improved flexibility of Automata designs. A finely wrought fusion of two long thought-to-be incompatible doctrines, she was not without flaws.

Boasting tremendous firepower in the form of her Meitou Edge Type 4 main battery guns, she could deal significant suppressive damage at far greater range, especially when overchraged. However, the sheer size of the weapon required a sacrifice of the ship's small caliber weaponry, including a majority of its point defense systems. Although this is somewhat mitigated by it's hangar bay allowing the deployment of interceptors. Ultimately, however, the ship was far more costly than it's in-service counterpart, the Rillaru-II, which delivered much of the same firepower for a fraction of the cost, with 
considerably more maneuverable to boot.

Nevertheless, any upcoming adventurous investor may stumble upon this forgotten prototype would find the ship worth every penny so long as it isn't thrown into impossible battles. She may not hold a candle to the mighty 'Warrior Princess' but if supported by enough friendlies - she will one day, be thriumphant and worthy of that recognition denied after so long.

A former warship turned against its maker, this converted Lillaru used to carry markings of a fallen Auroran task force squadron whom wandered too far from the safety of their own makeshift home, reasons unknown. After several skirmishes against the Aurorans, the local Hegemony garrison realized the potential of having such versatile ships in their midst. They would intentionally probed into Auroran space and engage unexpecting patrol flotillas, aimed to disable rather than destroying them. Once the surviving crew have been detained and forcefully relocated to their lifepods, they're launched off the ship and have their distress signal activated and their location intentionally transmitted to a known signal station nearby. 

This strange act of kindness may have helped in softening the impact of their piracy against the Federation as the consequences have been mildly acceptable by Hegemony standards to say the least. ""Our marines couldn't do much against their thick heavy armor as they boarded and steamrolled across our ships. They wore the sign of a golden turtle, golden stars and red background in their emblems."" are the repeated words given by survivors. ""They are... the Hegemony's Iron Shell.""

A one-of-a-kind modification for Admiral Mary Su Yi-Su's personal use based on her preferences, the ship was converted into a battlecarrier by opening both sides of the hull where the missile mounts used to be. The single large mount and its internal mechanism were removed in order to accommodate winged spacecraft and convert it into a hangar bay. Additionally, a pair of heavy Reflecta-class external armor plates were added for greater protection of the flight deck from incoming attacks.

Legend has it that the chief researcher responsible for the design managed to complete the project in two weeks. After being locked in her research lab without a key, the researcher dedicated their efforts to the Ularaya just to alleviate the boredom.

Due to lack of armor, the weight-to-power ratio is far greater and allow it to enjoy an increased top speed and acceleration rate despite it's heavy cruiser classification and size.

However, its unorthodox design made it unpopular amongst the already well established navy officers. It was initially left to be forgotten in a dockyard until a command neuko android forwarded a message that showed great interest in the ship by the automata high command. Since then, it finally entered service as a secondary heavy cruiser alongside the venerable Lillaru(SP) for the automata forces and first produced in small number.

It's hard to deny, that there are no official intelligence reports regarding this particular group even from the Domain-era days. It's clear though they have been around for several dozen cycles already and have already established several colonies, forming an isolated but self-sufficient economy to survive in this harsh sector but for how long? 

Countless questions are lingering about them. Where do they come from? Who are they and most importantly, why are they here? Unfortunately, most are left unanswered or dismissed. There are rumors and gossips that many may choose to believe or not. Some believed in the fact they're from Earth while others believed them to be another group of rejected colonies trying to establish a new power in the outskirts of the Sector. Regardless, none of them are true. The only truth is, they're outsiders in a hostile world that will never accept them for what they are.

The Permaisuri's wishes are as followed; 

""We must find a way to return home for we do not belong here. Stay true to yourselves and never give up. Together, we shall prevail and we will not leave anyone behind. That is my promise to you, my fellow people. Please believe in me.""
