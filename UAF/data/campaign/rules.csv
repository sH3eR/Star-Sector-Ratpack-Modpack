According to the report given by your lieutenants, the enemy used hit-and-run guerilla tactics as they often retreated and attacked from seemingly random directions. This unfortunate setback have caused your local commanders to temporarily retreat to fight another day.
OR
Your forces were on their way on board their armored vehicles to the nearest wreckage site but took the wrong way at a crossroad which led your men to an infamous mountainous trail known for its dangerous and unstable terrain. Apparently, all the blames were put on a clueless rookie lieutenant who felt too confident in their map reading skill.
OR
A single wounded survivor returned from their expedition, warning you and the others of a lone augmented pirate with a glowing sword-like weapon who managed to everyone but them. They soon collapsed onto the floor and you quickly rushed and shouted ""Medic!"" into the radio. Eventually the medical team arrived with their ambulance and took over from there, reassuring you that they will survive as the wound is not as serious as it looks.
OR
As you and your men are preparing themselves for an expedition to the sites, you saw an officer rushing from their weather surveillance camp  with a piece of paper in their hand. ""Wait, wait! There's a storm coming! Stop the expedition right now and find shelter immediately before its too late!"" they said while pointing at the odd cloudy formation at your back. You acknowledged and ordered the men to go back to their barracks and wait until the storm to pass. 

Unfortunately, not everyone made it out alive as some tents are either blown away or crumbled under snowy rubbles. 
OR
An armored convoy consists of several trucks and tracked vehicles departed from the base camp, you felt confident on this one as surely no pirate can match the firepower or even dare to ambush them. Then you received a transmission from the convoy leader who said the following with a disappointment in their voice. ""Sir.. I'm sorry to report that some of the vehicles veered off course and took the bait. They never came back after they disappeared into a tunnel. Apparently they saw a truck full of auroran choco lava and chibi limited edition queen figures and decided to go in on their own, we have to fall back for now sir."" 

You couldn't help but to just facepalm at the situation. 
OR
A team of elite marines armed to the teeth were sent to search and recover the lost black box located somewhere in one of these wreckage sites. Suddenly you saw flashes beyond the horizon and the ground trembles for several minutes. Everything became chaotic as your officers are doing their best to coordinate and manage from their end. Fortunately, some of your men returned but not all of them. ""God damn arty spam! I could've sworn those shells are guided and I have bullseye marked on my head.. not even foxhole can protect me from this god forsaken arty spam!"" one of them complained as they went to the nearby medical tent. 
OR
Apparently things did not go well for the expedition team. They have to temporarily halt and rest on a convenient yet suspiciously placed road-side restaurant in the middle no where. Everyone had their fill of delicious local cuisine as they watched some space sport show on a space television receiving transmission from some space satellites, somewhere out there in.. you guess it, space.

""I could have thrown you to hard labor for that. Just try not to get killed. I need someone to deliver some special cargo for the Permaisuri. I’d do it myself, but my presence tends to attract unwanted attention, and my associates aren’t exactly welcome at the palace.""

You run into the administrator as she exits the administration building. She looks dignified in her office uniform, contrasted by the very rough looking hulking guards next to her.
""Off-duty? I can show you a good place for you and your crew."" She smiles. This is one of the few instances you’ve seen her express joy.

The administrator leans in. ""Listen, starfarer. If you ever need a cannon or two to keep people off your back, don’t hesitate to buy them from the market here. They’re good quality and while they may not be as advanced as some of the newer Auroran stuff, it sure beats a naked hull.""

As you walk around Nur station, you recognize the familiar figure of the station administrator, Alexandra Yamato. You decide to surprise her and approach from behind, but this gets you mistaken for an assailant and you find yourself under a pile of burly bodyguards. After clearing the misunderstanding with the security team, you are taken to the medical section to receive treatment.
OR
""How do you feel about hijacking some ships, starfarer?"" The administrator asks you suddenly. Her amber eyes blaze with calculation, a wry smile on her face as she formulates a plan in her head. ""I may have a job or two for you and your crew in the near future.""",,

""About hijacking those ships. Keep that to yourself. Wouldn’t want anything unfortunate to happen to you."" The air itself seems to shill with the icy glare she gives you. After what feels like an eternity, she cracks a smile, and slides a drink into your hand. ""I jest. But seriously, keep it to yourself.""
OR
""I’m sorry, Starfarer. Can you wait a few hours? I have a problem that needs fixing. I’ll take you to a bar later, my treat!"" Before you can respond she cuts off the transmission.
OR
You make your way to the bar that Alexandra mentioned. You have gotten a feel for Nur Station’s seedy atmosphere and its unusual administrator. Despite this, you had established a working relationship and getting invited to drinks was not uncommon. 

As you round the final corner to the bar, the atmosphere seems to change, and a chill runs down your spine as a cold wind shoots through the alley. For being this close to a bar, the area is eerily empty. You press forward with caution, your hand ready on your side-arm. As the wind dies down, you barely make out the noise of footsteps following you. You whip around and fire at your would be assailant… Except they are much closer than you expected, blocking your arm and causing your shot to ricochet down the alley. ""Nice reflexes. But you’re late."" Chided Alexandra. ""Sorry if I spooked you, although given where we are, I shouldn’t be too surprised you’re on edge. C’mon, the drinks are waiting."" She practically drags you into the bar. The two of you enjoy your time, although you can’t help but feel like you’re being watched, and judging by her frequent glances around the bar, Alexandra can feel it too.
OR
You ask a pair of the guards to meet with Alexandra. After consulting each other briefly, one of them agrees to take you to her, and motions for you to follow. He leads you deeper in, and as you walk, you notice the usual gaudy decorations become more and more sparse, the voices of other people echoing throughout the halls grow dimmer, until at some point they seem to disappear altogether. The warm light of the lobby appears to have been replaced with harsh fluorescent lighting. The only sounds now were the footsteps of you and your escort.

Then came the scream. It rang throughout the hallway, echoing off the cold, featureless walls, stopping you in your tracks. A second one rings out, and your blood runs cold. As your mind races through several scenarios at where you could be headed, you notice that the screams have stopped… as had the guard you were with, waiting on you. As he hasn’t made any attempt to harm or arrest you, you come to the dreadful realisation that this was normal in this section of the palace, and the relief that whatever it was, you weren’t going to participate.

Or so you had hoped. The guard had led you to a steel door, and through it you could hear more muffled screaming. As well as the familiar voice of Alexandra. You can barely make out any words before you hear a loud snap, and more muffled screaming drowns her out. The guard orders you to wait here, and enters the chamber, and for a brief moment, you can hear Alexandra loud and clear. Betrayal. Or at least that’s what you were able to put together before the heavy steel door slammed shut, muffling the sound again.

After what seemed like hours, the muffled screams finally died down. Despite being fully alert, the eerie silence causes you to jump as Alexandra opens the door. ""Apologies for the wait. A certain problem needed fixing. Fancy a drink?"" She hands you what you assume to be a freshly poured glass. You start to question what that was about, before discretion gets the better of you. Sometimes it’s better to leave those things be, and you down the drink in hopes of taking your mind off the whole ordeal.
OR
""Thanks for the booze. I’ll be sure to reward you later down the line. Also, could you deliver a message to the Permaisuri for me?"" She twiddles her thumbs as she gives her request. ""Payment? Just put it on my tab. Do it for me, won’t you?"" You’re about to question why, when an ice cold glare cuts you off.
OR
""Starfarer, if anyone you run into asks about my activities, kindly keep a woman’s secrets."" She smiles politely as she cuts comms. At the dock, a UAF official takes you away for interrogation. However, thanks to Alexandra’s warning, you give nothing away. After an hour, he reluctantly lets you go.
OR
""Hello, starfarer."" She says over comms. ""The Permaisuri, I hope she said something good about me?"" You try to dance around her question for a few minutes.",,

OR
""You need a drinking buddy?"" You open your mouth to decline but close it as you see Alexandra’s unamused face. ""Be at the palace in an hour. See you there."" Despite her stern expression, Alexandra almost sounded like she was looking forward to it.
OR
""Do I hate the UAF?"" She repeats your question as she ponders the answer over drinks. ""I suppose I might come off that way. No, I do not. Nothing could make me betray my queen."" Her eyes are alive with conviction toward her words.
OR
""Why is it called a palace? Because it’s the center of my kingdom, you know."" She gestures all around her. ""This bar is merely a part of my domain. These drinks on the table, merely products of my kingdom. Perhaps one day, you’ll live long enough to attend one of my parties!"" She gives a boisterous laugh.
OR
""Favonius? It’s the sparkling Jewel of the Federation. A beautiful resort world, I must say. I tried inviting the Permaisuri to accompany me there but…"" Alexandra pouts for a bit, but it doesn’t last long. ""Anyway, I shall continue to work hard to earn her favor. What rank are you? Have you been promoted yet? Help me set a meeting!""
OR
Over drinks you accidentally compliment her. She gives a hearty laugh.

""Sorry, $playerName. I only have eyes for my Permaisuri."" She says sadly. ""You’re lucky! If I was wearing pants, I could hunt you down in a heartbeat! Ugh! Waiter! Another round!"" She drinks away her frustration. You wonder if this means she’ll start calling you by your name in the near future.
OR
It was late in the evening and you, Alexandra, and your security teams were on the way back to the palace. You and the administrator were trading stories as usual.

""Hearing of your escapades has been quite the experience. I don’t get to see much beyond this space station. Don’t get me wrong, I have quite the paid leave stacked up, however there is no point in leaving if there is no one to share the moment with."" She let’s out a sigh as she grabs your arm, nuzzling herself onto you. ""My parents used to tell me stories growing up. They were full of brave warriors and scenic battles. They were so proud to tell me of our heritage."" Alexandra looked up. Perhaps she was looking at the stars beyond?
OR
""No. No. No. No."" Alexandra is taking shots of varying dark liquids. ""No. Dammit! Oh, you’re here. Don’t mind me, just trying out different hot chocolates."" She says matter of factly. 
""The recipe was lost during a pirate raid and I have been trying to recreate it since. One day I’ll torch that station of theirs to ashes."" For a moment she seethes with rage, clenching her teeth. Remembering your presence, she composes herself by pouring a drink. She apologizes, rescheduling your meeting to a later time.
OR
Once again, Alexandra invites you to a bar in a seedy location. You are accompanied by a squad of guards this time. You notice the noise from nearby people gets more and more distant the closer you get to the agreed upon location. You keep your side-arm ready as you feel yourself being watched. After going around a corner, two of your guards in front of you go down, and you take cover back the way you came. You hear no gunshots but hear the projectiles as they land. Micro-needles, so smooth they were almost invisible, shatter upon where you had been a moment ago. You call for reinforcements from your fleet just as two gunshots ring out further down the corridor you were travelling. 

""You can come out!"" Recognizing Alexandra’s voice, you do so with your side-arm ready to fire. You see her, rifle in hand, surrounded by what you assume to be her guards in full-gear. ""Apologies, we knew they were tailing you for quite a while. We needed time to get their whole cell."" She gives you a cursory look, making sure you were not injured. After more of her people come to secure and clear the scene you then continue on for drinks, your crew upset they were used as bait.",,

A woman with dark hair, dressed in a black suit and sunglasses puts a finger on her lips. You hesitate on how to handle the situation. ""Play along."" She whispers. You recognize the administrator immediately. She inches closer. From a distance it would look as if two people were holding each other. A moment passes. From her lips, you imagine she has her usual stiff expression. Was she waiting for something?

From the corner of your eye, you see movement. Two unremarkable men pass by both of you. As soon as they pass her, she whips out a pistol gunning them down. Two shots to the body each and the collapse to the ground. A clean-up crew passes by soon after, and she thanks you for your assistance.

Without a word, she bids you goodbye. You overhear her speak of another target, though you know better than to inquire. You decide to forget all about the incident.
OR
Alexandra meets you at the planetside dock. She must have had some time away from the office, waving at you as your shuttle touches down on the landing pad. You greet her, and she gives a look like she noticed something.

""More new faces? Something happen?"" 

""Business as usual,"" you say with a shrug.

Pleasantries over, the two of you and your security teams continue on your way. You recount to her yet another misadventure as you two walk to another bar. Lately, Alexandra has been taking you to more and more private establishments, all under her explicit protection. These locales are generally higher end, and you can see her networking skills at work. She greets the bouncer, asks how the staff’s families are, advises some acquaintances and checks on business associates, all in a matter of minutes. The owner ingratiates himself by giving her, and by extension you and the security teams, the best tables in the establishment. You can’t help but notice an increase in the quality of the decor, and interior design. It almost rivals the best Tri-tachyon has to offer.

Alexandra seems as jovial as always but she keeps an eye on your newer guards. Once she outdrinks them, just as she always does, she sits beside you to talk.

""Apologies if I seemed cautious, but I can’t be too careful. I may trust you, but pragmatism is what has gotten me this far."" She leans on your shoulder, suddenly finding interest in the half-filled glass on the table.

""You’re quite the interesting one, $playerName. Not many live to see me like this. In my line of work, friends either turn out to be traitors, or wind up as cadavers. Such is the life we live."" She smiles bitterly as she looks at you. ""Yet look at them,"" Alexandra turns her head toward both your security teams, half drunk asleep, and the rest enjoying UAF cuisine. ""Even here on Nur, her dream persists. Quite infectious."" She nuzzles deep into your shoulder, lulling herself to sleep.

You and your teams escort her home after finishing your meals.
OR
The comm link opens and Alexandra seems to be in the middle of paperwork.

""Ah, $playerName, do you have a moment?"" She grabs a hold of her holo-pad and taps a few keys. A moment later, an image of two dresses appears on your terminal. ""Which one should I wear to Aeria’s birthday ball? I know it’s a long way away but I want to look my best."" You help advise her on fashion for a few hours.
OR
""$playerName, you’ve arrived. Come to my palace, I have something to share with you.""

You are escorted by her guard through the palace gate and left at the door to her main office. You find Alexandra with a steaming steel mug. She hands it to you. 

""Careful, it’s hot."" You cautiously sip the murky brown liquid. Its bitter taste causes you to wince. 

""Strong, isn’t it?"" She shrugs. ""Not quite the family recipe but it’s close. Feel free to have some more. We made too much."" You and Alexandra distribute mugs of hot chocolate to the administration staff.
OR
On one of your visits to the administration complex, you find Alexandra not in her usual office but in her court, dressed in strange armor. She is locked in combat, duelling a hulking man with staves to an audience of hundreds of her subordinates. Her opponent is all muscle. The armor struggles to contain his frame. Alexandra is at a disadvantage, struggling to block his blows due to his advantage in strength and reach, she is slowly pushed back. She dives, rolls and attacks behind one of her opponents knees causing him to fall to the floor. Her assault continues, now focusing on the man’s back and then places her staff on his neck. The match has concluded. The audience cheers in praise. She smiles as she helps up her foe, grabbing a drink each for the two of them.

""Ad Astra!"" She yells before downing it.

The response she receives is louder than Sindria’s fanatics, prouder than Hegemony’s loyalists, and more terrifying than the howls of Ludd’s zealots.

""AD ASTRA! TO THE STARS!""
OR
As you are approaching Nur Station to dock with it, you receive a message from Alexandra on your Tri-Pad. ""You are cordially invited to the Administrator of Nur Station’s Night of Merriment. Contained in this invitation are specifics to be adhered to…"" It was a long and particular list about formal wear and where to purchase said items. The time for Alexandra’s party had arrived.
OR
In one of the many zones against sobriety aboard Nur Station, you wind up escorting Alexandra, steadying her by being her support. Though she usually can handle her liquor, repeated visits from business associates seem to have taken a toll on her. Thus, she is oversaturated by alcohol to the point of losing her balance.

""I appreciate the escort, $playerName."" She says. Your security team forms an outer ring around the two of you, while Alexandra’s hulking guards form the middle ring. ""I know you’re curious. Why let you tag along when I have my own security services? Insurance."" She giggles, poking your side a little too harshly. Her sharp fingernail is an annoyance you tolerate.

""Tell me, $playerName, am I beautiful?"" The questions stuns you. Looking at Alexandra, her face is anything but bashful. She bears a grim expression, demanding complete honesty.

You reply, and she giggles again, seemingly pleased.

""Thank you. I appreciate your candor. Now if only, she’d say those words…""

""$playerName, I’ll pay you! Shoot down any escaping craft! Let no ship leave the station!""
You quickly order your crew to battle stations and maneuver your fleet for a blockade. Your ship’s sensors find three ships preparing to take off. Evacuating. One of the ships begins to ascend a few meters before a well placed shot from one of your escorts manages to cripple the engines, bursting into a fireball before exploding from the detonation of the rest of its fuel cells. Another, catching shrapnel, fails to take off. The last one disengages its thrusters after an hour of small arms fire. You decide to put your security teams and marines on alert as you wait for Alexandra to give you further instructions.

""Good work out there. We managed to flush out the whole Pather network but they managed to sabotage a lot of my smaller escorts. Damn bastards. Thanks for the assist. I may have need of your fleet until we sort this out, so don’t go anywhere."" She gives you a nod of approval before terminating the connection.
OR
""$playerName, come to my office. Don’t delay."" Alexandra’s raspy voice was tinged with excitement.

You find the administrator indulging in a hot beverage from a steel mug. ""Ah, I think this is the one."" She quickly hands you a cup for yourself.

The taste of the hot chocolate is warm and bitter, though a very subtle sweetness makes itself known.

""Good, isn’t it?"" She asks, smiling, confident in your response. ""My ancestors were proud warriors. They were knights, you see. My clan and their country were crushed in a matter of weeks. Resistance was futile. Such was the time during which the Permaisuri’s grandmother reigned."" She takes a sip before continuing.

""Bloodshed is all my clan has lived for, and this,"" She gestures to the drink in her hands. ""Is but a hobby. Though the time of knights has long passed, there is still no shortage of enemies. That will never change. We do what we have to, in order to survive. Such is my way, and the way of the Permaisuri. I pray we never meet as foes, $playerName. I’d hate to kill a friend."" She smiles bitterly. 

You enjoy your drink with the administrator.
OR
As you make your way to the palace complex with your digital invitation, you are briefly inspected and allowed inside. Attendees dressed in strange fashions, and the air was filled with the scent of alcohol. You only recall meeting Alexandra and in a wonderful dress and a towering blue-haired woman.

A night of revelry that you cannot comprehend ensues. You and Alexandra have an unforgettable evening as the closest of friends.

It’s a shame you cannot remember any details from it. The morning greets you with a terrible hangover. Somehow, Alexandra, your security team and a few others managed to send you back to your ship. Asking the guards and the staff only earns you silence. 

You enter Alexandra’s office finding her suffering to a lesser degree than you.

""You don’t remember? A shame. We drank so much and you danced with quite a few notable figures."" She says quite happy with herself. ""It was a wonderful time. Suffice to say, I thank you for your companionship during the evening.""

Alexandra hums sweetly to herself in her chair.
OR
""$playerName, can you be my sparring partner?"" You and Alexandra engage each other with staves, and in training armor. You both manage to batter and bruise each other, entertaining occasional onlookers.

""You’d have made an excellent knight with enough training, $playerName."" She says over drinks.

The next morning, you are incapacitated for a few hours due to your injuries.
OR
""$playerName. I have an urgent mission for you."" She sends you a digital invitation for Permaisuri Charlotte III’s birthday. ""Though I could manage on my own, I refuse to leave anything to chance."" Her face is of grim determination and resolve. How could you say no to a friend in need?

You go through a lengthy fitting, sampling the best Alexandra’s money can buy. Fabrics from all across the Persean sector, from Tri-Tachyon synthetic weaves to painstakingly handwoven Luddic cloths, are considered for you and Alexandra’s attire. She has long prepared in advance for herself, now merely finalising the arrangements. You were a recent advantage that she decided to leverage. Your renown, your achievements, as well as the favor the UAF has for you, are valuable cards to play to earn Charlotte III’s favor. 

You and Alexandra make quite an entrance clothed in classic black, accompanied by her personal security team of goliaths and olympians. You are handsome in your suit, cleaned up into refinement. Everyone is dressed to the nines, and the competition for extravagance is fierce. Guests get in line to greet the Permaisuri on her special day and one by one you all are introduced. Your turn comes. Alexandra grips your arm a little too tightly during the first few steps on the carpet heading toward the monarch of the UAF. 

Permaisuri Aeria Charlotte Yuki, more popularly abbreviated to Charlotte III, is a blue-haired, chromatic-eyed, captivating giant of a woman. Her dress is simple yet elegant, classy yet functional. The grey-blue palette highlights her features well. Flanked by her Royal Guards, she commands respect.

You and Alexandra draw close, the holo-screens failing to do her attractiveness justice.

""Starfarer. Administrator. I thank you for the great service you have done for all Aurorans."" She nods ever so slightly, a major acknowledgement to both your and Alexnadra’s efforts. Then she turns to Alexandra.

""Though I will never truly know your sacrifices, I would not live to see another year were it not through your great contributions."" Charlotte III smiles toward Alexandra, though her eyes are difficult to read. Alexandra is stunned for a brief second.

""It is an honor to hear such words from you, Your Majesty. I have toiled to exceed your expectations."" She says with more humility and embarrassment than you expected, lowering her head.

""It is I who is honored by you and your service. Please, do not hesitate to contact me for assistance, if required."" You bow and Alexandra curtsies as you give thanks to the Permaisuri, making your exit, joining the other guests.

Once hidden behind the other guests, Alexandra loosens slightly, a huge burden off her shoulders. She is completely red from her neck to her ears.

""What?"" Alexandra asks sternly, unable to hide her flustered face.

""Nothing. Nothing at all."" 

Alexandra drinks considerably after the party concludes.",,

You are guided toward Lunamun’s surface, its highways, roads, and industrial centers lit up by the light of civilization. 

An azure Neuko floats weightlessly near the landing pad, the tendrils from her hair swishing as if in an invisible ocean. The shuttle touches down on the barren surface, shaking the ship for a brief moment before you start taking off your seatbelts. Your guards put on their sealed suits, checking weapons before disembarking.

You are greeted by the rugged surface of Lunamun. Your hearing dulls as the absence of air mutes sounds save for those coming from within your suit. A musical chime coming from your commlink grabs your attention, and you turn toward the approaching ethereal Nueko.

""Hello, $playerName."" Her expressionless face clashes with the softness in her synthetic voice. ""It is a pleasure to greet you in person.""

AER-1A, seeming more like an alien aquatic lifeform than an artificial android, glides toward you. She is free and at home in the vacuum of space. There is a serenity about her form, enhanced by her defiance of gravity. Looking down at you, she seems to study you for a moment.

""Come. I shall facilitate all arrangements during your stay for a seamless experience."" She says with some glee. Holograms depicting stylized eyes depict a happy expression on her visor, as she guides you briefly on your visit to Lunamun.
OR
""Hello, $playerName. I have some time to spare. Tell me, what do you think about the UAF?"" She eagerly awaits your opinion. You give your honest opinion, and AER-1A listens to every word patiently and without anxiety. When you finish, she takes her leave ending only with.

OR
""Hello, $playerName."" AER-1A’s synthetic voice had an almost musical lilt to it this time. ""I shall await your imminent arrival. Be at ease.""

True to her word, your landing is smooth and without delay. Once again, the ethereal AER-1A hovers toward you.

""I am pleased to see you."" Holograms she developed convey her smiling over her steely exterior. She accompanies you as she takes you around Lunamun.
OR
On one of your visits, you ask what her role is in the UAF. 

""I am in charge of monitoring and maintaining Neukos across the Federation. In addition I also help maintain Lunamun’s industries and bases.""

She paused as she executed a perfect ninety-degree angle turn toward you. She is silent for a moment. Contemplating a response perhaps? Or is she just accommodating you as a human? 

""I hope you find that answer satisfactory.""
OR
On one of your visits to Lunamun…

""My best memory? Subjective statements are not this unit’s strong suit. If I were to review them as a human would, my best memories are seeing the smiles of the citizens of the UAF.""

You ask for clarification.

""$playerName, what logic drives your decisions?"" AER-1A turns to you with robotic precision. Her blank visor, void of all holograms, seems judging, as if seeing past and through you to an unknown depth and degree that only she was capable of.

""Your exponential growth is only matched by your equally exponential impact on the space you inhabit. Such a tenacious variable is exceedingly rare in this hostile environment.""
OR
As you enjoy your visit to Lunamun, you, AER-1A, and your security team find yourselves in one of Lunamun’s cafés. A vast dome of metal bars and transparent triangular panels gives you an excellent view of Lunamun’s surface. Like a beautiful gem, New Aurora slowly turns on its axis, a blue sphere with layers of green and white glistening off in the distance.

""$playerName, what do you think of New Aurora? Do you find it beautiful? Idyllic? Or perhaps you detest its naiveté, its weakness?""

AER-1A is looking directly at you, still floating perfectly in mid-air.

""Why do you choose to side with the UAF? Is it because of idealism? A sense of purpose? Or are your motivations more… pragmatic? Mercenary?""
OR
AER-1A walks you through a Neuko storage facility. Rows of inactive Neukos are standing by in maintenance. You notice that instead of being a single assembled construct, Neukos are instead a collection of major components loosely connected by ball joints. They seem to be held together through magnetism, with no body part actually making contact with one another.

""As you can see, the modularity of the Neukos ensures ease of maintenance and customizability, ensuring cost-efficiency and market satisfaction.""

Curious, you ask why she would show you a valuable trade secret. As if expecting this, she responds.

""Because I wish to ask you to what extent do you consider yourself… you. How would you define the existence that is $playerName? What experiences and components make up the entity known as the starfarer?""
OR
""$playerName."" AER-1A hovers toward you. ""It is good to see you. May I request I speak with you alone?""

You sense your security team tense up.

""Worry not. We’ll only need to be a few paces away, and I request you momentarily disable your commlink with your security team.""

Though you feel uneasy, the numbers difference is quite clear. With some reluctance you accompany the Neuko, your footsteps heavy during the walk. You and AER-1A move a few paces away, still very much within view, and therefore within shooting distance, of your security team.

""I will ask of you a favor. Do check in with the Permaisuri from time to time. Even if when you have become old and frail, do visit her until you are no longer able.""
OR
You and AER-1A are overlooking a city center, the multi-colored fluorescence saturating the urban landscape and the surrounding rocky terrain. You and your team had just finished having lunch at a nearby Lunamun restaurant when AER-1A said she wanted to take you somewhere.

From atop an observation deck, it provides a perfect vantage point toward the city and its people. Most citizens forego traveling outside in vacuum-sealed suits and instead travel within the interiors. Tunnels and sealed walkways bridge the structures together. For extensive travel, a subway system connects even the most distant of facilities. Occasionally, you see the odd maintenance unit or military patrol. The city seemed practically deserted from the outside. You ask AER-1A why she brought you here.

""I wanted to see your reaction."" AER-1A had no holograms conveying emotions. ""I’ve heard it described as beautiful. Appealing locations according to my research can incite dynamic reactions in humans.""

""Am I trying to quantify beauty?"" She utters your question precisely as you are about to ask it, as though she were reading your mind. ""No. Seeing the elation on those I bring here is part of my purpose. It is a capacity I was designed for.""

""Who designed you?""

""I’m sorry, $playerName. That is classified. Though I thank you for your concern.""

""$playerName, I have prepared a special venue today."" Behind AER-1A is a rover capable of seating eight people. Enough for you and your security team. You and the rest climb aboard, however, when you try to operate the vehicle, it remains unresponsive.

""That will be unnecessary, I have already given the course to the vehicle. There is no need to trouble yourself."" As if on cue, the vehicle starts on its own, and you are on your way.

The Robo-Queen leads you out into the lunar valleys, quite a distance away from your shuttle. The trip is initially silent, save for your breathing and occasional mutterings from your team over comms, but AER-1A decides to liven up your trip. She broadcasts music over the comms. You expect protest but not one security member complains.

""Comm check, still hearing me?"" You ask them over the music playing in your space suit.
""A-firm."" The rest of your security detail give similar answers. Feeling grateful you give your thanks to her.
""Thank you, AER-1A. They really appreciate your kindness."" 

 With her usual unnatural grace, she turns toward you.
""Thanks is not necessary. As always, I shall ensure you enjoy your stay. However, today is unique.""

""I cannot answer that question.""

""You can’t answer why today is unique?""

Though puzzled you decide to let it slide until you reach your destination. Like an oasis on a desert world, you see something alien in the landscape of uneven terrain and moondust. A perfect transparent dome lies beneath the open starry sky. As you get closer, you see a small circular door, big enough for a human to enter. The vehicle stops, and you disembark.

""Welcome. Please, make yourselves at home."" She smiles, the holographic blush making her a cheerful light in the darkness out here. The door opens into an airlock which seals you in and fills with air. After AER-1A says it is safe to breathe, you and your team take off your helmets. The next door creaks and opens with a hiss. The interior of the dome is idyllic, grass of some kind lines the ground. A piece of checkered cloth is spread out. On it are baskets and baskets of food. Bread, porridge, soups, biscuits, and many other dishes you cannot name. It was a feast.

""Go ahead, feel free to have as much as you like.""

Your escorts look to you, asking for permission, and sensing no harm, you decide to let them lounge about. You enjoy yourself, the music now barely audible. Everyone chats amongst themselves, though refraining from the wine. You can’t help but feel at ease at this meal in this alien oasis beneath the stars. You look for your host, who is patiently watching you.

""Care to join us?""

""If you would have me, I would gladly participate.""

You converse with AER-1A until the meal is finished.
OR
During one of your visits to repair and resupply on Lunamun, you ask AER-1A a question.

""AER-1A, why are you so interested in my responses?""

""Because you are a variable with high potential."" She says without hesitation.

""I’ve asked this before but what do you mean by variable?""

""You are an existence whose potential outcomes are dynamic. Your position in this sector will cause rippling effects that may shake the polities of this sector to their most basic levels.""

""You are saying I’m important?"" You ask with some pride.

""I am saying you could be if you so desired.""

You’re feeling a little smug when something occurs to you. Had it been anyone else, you might not have given it a second thought. But machines need evidence to develop a pattern. These aren’t some words of encouragement, but a mechanical statement of fact. Another question comes to mind. 

""How long have you been observing me?"" You ask with alarm.

""Ever since you arrived."" Her response is without delay.

""Am I being monitored right now?"" She confirms with complete honesty. Disturbed, you ask how far. 

""That is classified."" Her face is unmoving. Pushing down brewing concerns you try and redirect your approach.

""Why are you telling me this?"" You ask trying to ascertain her motives.

""Because your trust is valuable.""

""Why do you need my trust?""

""That is classified."" Another brick wall in the conversation.  She asks for your trust, but still refuses to divulge her secrets. Even those that directly involve you.

""What do you need me for?""

""To help the UAF.""

You ask her to explain but all she gives you are the same requests she hands you routinely. It doesn’t add up for whatever grand scheme you’ve found yourself involved in.

""So you just want me to trust you?""

""Correct.""

""Why?""

""To help the UAF.""

""Why do you need me to help the UAF?""

""That’s classified."" There are those words again. It’s becoming clear that there is another force at play, whether that be a person or some vague directive, you cannot tell. What’s more, she’s deflecting any attempts to directly discern the truth.  You decide on a more roundabout approach with an open-ended question.

""What can you tell me about what you plan for me to do?""

""Whatever your choice, I cannot force you to help the UAF. My purpose is to ensure the optimum chances of its continuation and the peace of its population. I can only ask that you help the UAF. Help the Permaisuri. That is my request of you.""

You aren’t quite satisfied with the answer. The who’s and why’s still remain unanswered, the end goal vague and all-encompassing, but at least you know she will aid you so long as your interests align.
OR
On a visit to Lunamun, you revealed to AER-1A that your next step would be Favonius…

""I wish you a lovely time, $playerName. Do enjoy some vanilla ice cream for me.""

For a moment, you think she sounds sad.

""Would like one?"" You offer, feeling a bit sorry for her.

""Yes, however, I would not be able to enjoy it. I am grateful for the offer, $playerName. Thank you.""

Her holograms on her face depict a beaming smile. 

You decide to get her a vanilla ice cream-themed souvenir while you’re there.
OR
""Hobbies? The Permaisuri introduced me to making paper airplanes. When I asked how such a pastime would serve me in my duties, she simply smiled. Supposedly ‘doing so makes wishes come true.’ As for whether or not it does, I make one or two when an opportunity arises.""

She finishes one in almost an instant, letting it fly, soaring off into the vastness of space.",,

Somehow your player-like perfect memory allowed you to remember exactly where you need to go and which corner or hallway to go.

Eventually you arrived at AER-1A's observation chamber where you would see the robo-queen floating freely in the air as usual. There is an exception however, there is now a brand new set of fresh chairs and tables imported directly from New Aurora for people to sit and conduct business with now. You decided to sit down on the most comfiest chair that grant the most wonderful view of both the floating queen and space background and make yourself comfortable. An opening suddenly appeared on the table where a cup of hot served tea would appear from it, ready just for you.

It's undeniable that some have done terrible things for joy, power, and ultimately, survival. Since it's obvious that Persean Sector is a harsh world that will show no mercy to anyone and anything, I can't help but wonder..."" Aeria sighs and looks away frowning.

""That reminds me of a music box I once had. It was a gift from a family member, you see. She made it herself. It had a very beautiful silver swan, turning, as if taking off for the first time from a pool of water. It is a shame I can no longer remember the melody it once played. It must have been beautiful, I’m sure. Forgive me for prattling on."" She looks at you, misty-eyed.
OR
The office is quiet when you enter. You glance at the desk, devoid of papers. A pot of tea has gone cold, and the biscuits lack their signature smell of freshness. You quickly look for the owner of the office, and you find her as she stands gazing out the window, posture stern. Yet it seems odd. You wait for a moment that feels like hours. The Royal Guard marines remain motionless. As do you.
""Many years ago, starfarer, I was once a child like that one."" She gestures out the window. ""She was a curious girl, full of naive wonder. I pray no one else has to make the decisions she had to."" Realizing Aeria was referring to herself, you are stunned. The rest of your visit is spent in silence before she permits you to leave.",,

""$playerName, may I bore you with a fact about myself? You may know my full title as Permaisuri Aeria Charlotte the Third, correct? There's also the 'Visionary Dreamer of the Stars and Beyond'. In my heart, I strived to be an explorer and always admired the stars from my humble little balcony. I was only a princess, back then. To be honest, I envy you, starfarer. I wish I had your wings of freedom and fly unto the sea of stars, free from any obligations to the world around you. You can do whatever you see fit."" She forces a smile, her eyes vacant. Her mask finally cracks beneath the weight of the Federation, revealing that she has been despondent and isolated this whole time.

As you are keeping her company in her office, she breaks the silence. ""You know, $playerName, sometimes I wonder if my life was destined to be this way from the very beginning.
OR
""I was just visiting one of the nearby hospitals and…"" She cannot seem to look at you. ""Please… please take care, $playerName."" As she is on the verge of tears, you help her to her office, helping her calm down with a cup of tea. She lays back in her seat, falling into the soft arms of unconsciousness. You keep watch for a moment, before making your exit. You notify Aeria’s assistant to bring her a blanket.
OR
""I apologize for my remark about seeing my doll collection."" She abruptly starts one meeting. She finds it hard to look at you, clearly remorseful. ""Such a thing is… no longer possible, I’m afraid."" Her smile now is uneasy. ""Were it so easy, I would have loved to show it to you."" She chuckles. 
""Kindly settle for my embarrassment of my childish self."" Relieved at last, she then asks about your misadventures, and surprises you by asking if anyone else has caught your attention in her domain. You try your best not to sputter your tea.
OR
As you enter her office, you smell something burning and find the blue-haired woman with peculiar goggles and  tweezers, with various gears, gyros and levers strewn across the desk. At your raised eyebrow, she responds cheerfully.
""Oh, Captain $playerName! Good to see you in good health!"" She beckons you to come closer, and you can see she is working on a clockwork device.
""Remember that music box I told you about? Though it is a shame I cannot recreate the tune, I thought of remaking a music box in the exact same style. Though it shan’t be the exact one from my memory, the joy from having it shall live on."" She beams happily. ""Don’t you think that’s wonderful?""

""I have considered you one of my most precious comrades and trusted friends. Please, should you find any leads to bring us back, no matter how minor, please… Let me know.""

""I am very thankful for your contributions to UAF. I honestly hope that your relationship with us will remain steadfast and unending."" As you fill her in, she continues to be amazed at the strangeness of your adventures. Captivated, you have your usual conversation with the Permaisuri. Upon the end of your meeting, she wishes for your continued success.
OR
Upon your arrival, your foot has not left the disembarkment ramp when you are suddenly ambushed. A lone figure crashes into you, and your reflexes quickly reach for your sidearm. Your security team jumps into action, trying to pry the masked assailant off of you.
""Wait!"" You hear someone yell, the voice ringing with familiarity. ""It is I!"" The assailant lowers her face mask, revealing the porcelain face of Permaisuri Aeria Charlotte III. Realizing she’s merely wearing a dark-haired wig you quickly tell your guards to stand down. Looking behind her, she asks you to quickly follow her. She drags you by the hand into an access tunnel, ""No guards!"" She declares she is trusting you with her life, she asks for the same from you. 

You reluctantly tell your guards to stay behind. After a brief maze-run, she finds a car in a vehicle depot, rapidly unlocking its doors. You both get in and with a key that might have been stolen, she drives away. A pair of Auroran military police vehicles reach the garage moments after you make your exit, somehow getting away unnoticed. 
After some distance, she takes off her mask, laughing.
""I have not had fun like this in ages! Where do you wish to go? What do you wish to see?"" She asks excitedly, still out of breath. You give the choice to her.
""You know what I have always wanted to do? Just eat at a restaurant in the middle of nowhere. No work. No rabble. Nothing but food and good company."" Her face is clearly jubilant. 

""Care to join me, $playerName?"" You find no reason to refuse. The two of you enjoy a lovely casual dinner, located in one of New Aurora’s agricultural zones. She seems almost like a different person from the dignified monarch that you are accustomed to. Her laugh seems louder, and her smile is the widest you have ever seen. However all things must come to an end, the meal put to an end by an exasperated assistant. The occupants, though few in number, cannot help but stare and murmur. Though he has no words but the gasps in his breath, Aeria pities the man and reluctantly accompanies him, no doubt back to the palace. Before she departs, she flashes you a gleeful smile, nudging your shoulder. No doubt this would be a day to remember.
OR
As your shuttle attempts to dock at New November City, you receive a message on your handheld terminal. It only provides you with a set of coordinates, the words ‘business-casual’, and a time: twenty minutes from now. Curious, you decide to meet, making sure to bring a sizable security detail as backup. You survey the area, finding the location of a well-populated café. You and your team, disperse amongst the youthful crowd, their chatter filled with banalities alien to you. As you try to look for an open seat in the packed café, someone grabs your arm. 

""You arrived!"" She says in an excited whisper. ""I always wanted to see what it was like in a café. Students over there rushing to meet their deadlines. Aspiring artists seeking new inspiration. Professionals talking about progress. The sound of people all hoping for a better tomorrow is music to my ears."" Though her eyes were covered by sunglasses you can make out the chromatic cybernetic eyes of the queen. You sit down slowly, trying your best not to attract attention. You see her, dressed in a sleeveless top and a pencil skirt. Though disguised by a woman’s beret and tied into a ponytail, her hair is a clear marker of her identity. She enjoys what you assume to be fresh coffee, a cheeky smile on her lips.

She takes a sip of her coffee. ""Ah. Is it not sweet, $playerName?"" You decide to join her and stand to order your coffee, enjoying the atmosphere. Though the noise is a din, there is a charm to the sound. Finding her striking, you compliment her outfit.

""I… I was wondering if my choice of clothes were appropriate."" She looks away bashfully, red in the face. She twiddles with her hair, trying to calm her nerves. ""Someone of my stature often gets gawked at, out in public. I appreciate your honesty, $playerName.""

Aeria does not hesitate to contribute to the ambience surrounding you.
""Indulge me, $playerName. What are your hopes for the future?""
You cannot seem to recall the last time someone asked you that.
Time blurs into a happy moment of coffee and conversation.
OR
As you arrive to offload your cargo for local markets, you get a call from Aeria to head for a nearby park ASAP and to come alone. Fearing the worst, you delegate the situation to your crew, and have an extraction team on standby, ready to launch. You manage to secure transport and rush to the park. You search for Aeria in a sea of people, when you hear someone call out, ""$playerName?""

You turn around behind you, and find Aeria in a long summer dress, a wide-brimmed hat protecting her from the sun’s rays. You are full of questions. After she helps you get a change of clothes from one of the nearby boutiques, you situate yourselves on a picnic table that Aeria has managed to reserve. You see slides and a variety of pools. Men and women all clad in swimsuits. You focus on Aeria, her hair billowing in the wind. ""I decided to get some fresh air. It is quite the coincidence you arrived when you did."" You doubt the odds of that.

""As a matter of fact, I prepared some extra sandwiches for today, I hope it is to your liking. I hope I can help you eat better meals, while you are here."" Her eyes plead with you to try one. Eating into fresh produce truly makes a difference in the final product. The taste of fresh tomatoes, the crispness of farm-grown lettuce, and the spice and succulence of the roasted chicken is truly indulgent. It does not take long for your portions to be devoured. 

""Hungry were we?"" She laughs. After your meal, the two of you go sightseeing. She implores you to interact with the waterside attractions, yet you remain curious why she won’t herself. ""I wanted to."" She hesitates. ""I am afraid a swimsuit does not suit me."" She shakes her head.
""Worry not about me. Go, allow me to live vicariously through you."" You pause. Sensing your hesitation, she continues. ""Go, enjoy it."" She beams at you and you celebrate in the waters to your heart’s content. 

As the sun sets and you make your way to leave, Aeria speaks.
""It was fun watching you play in the water, $playerName. I hope one day you will bring those close to you to enjoy this place."" You make a mental note to set aside a budget for the extraction team to visit.
OR
The moment your ship is within communication range, an urgent message arrives.
""Captain $playerName, I have a favor to ask."" Apparently, the officer who was supposed to be her escort to the ball was suddenly injured and she urgently needed someone to fill in. Time was short, and though inexperienced with formal events, you are familiar with military ceremonies and decorum. You also had the trust of Aeria Charlotte III herself, such was explained to you. And so, you made planetfall with a small five-man squad. The Permaisuri assured of your safety, yet you always wanted a few of your people planetside just to be safe. As soon as the shuttle landed, she herded you and your subordinates into a limousine, caught up in her pace, once again.

""I have always wanted to try picking outfits for someone. I do hope you don’t mind."" You tell your squad to put up with Aeria’s requests for the time being. Measurements are taken, fabrics are chosen, cloth is sewn, and suits are made. Though you were uncertain at first, the outfits provided to you and your comrades give a wide range of movement.

""Impressed? They give decent personal protection as well."" Aeria said proudly. ""Dare I say, you people look splendid!"" Pleased with herself, you escort her to the ball. Located in the great hall of the Auroran palace, it is one of the events where esteemed guests interact and foster rapport. The Permaisuri will be expected to make an appearance. As the starfarer, your reputation within the United Auroran Federation preceded you. As you walked those glamorous steps toward the great hall, you and Aeria //Try ""the queen"" or ""Aeria""// were the center of attention. 
Thankfully, Aeria’s assistant had imparted enough knowledge on social protocol and you manage to survive the evening, netting even a few admirers and fans. But as the hour grew late, you opted to retire for the evening. You and Aeria take respite on one of the balconies nearby, the cool evening air alleviating your weariness.

""I appreciate you coming to my aid, $playerName. Forgive me for using your fame during your time here."" She said sheepishly, clearly tired. You delay your retirement a little longer. Aeria gifted some remaining Auroran vintages for which your crew was ever grateful.
""I know such events might be pointless to you. But traditions such as these bind us to each other… and to our home."" Her stern speech masks her drowsiness. ""I hope you understand that my request shows how esteemed you are within this world. Good night."" Before you can say more, she walks away to the care of two Royal Guard marines.
""Good night, Your Majesty.""
OR
It is late one evening on your ship when you receive a communique from Aeria, discovering she is right outside your ship. She awaits with a few bottles in hand, her mixed security team of DNS-types and protective agents forming a steady perimeter. Joining you are familiar women. One stern, one demure, one arrogant, one grounded, and one vacantly smiling.
""I hoped this would be a good time to form bonds. I was told by Solvernia that this was one of the more effective ways of achieving that goal."" Aeria says. And with that the festivities begin. As the night crawls on, the liquor flows, and emotions are inevitably vented. What happens next is anyone’s guess. 

You wake the next morning, groggy and sluggish. Pain wracks your entire being and your head feels as though it’s tearing itself apart. After a trip to the medbay, your medics inform you that you received massive blunt force trauma to the face. Multiple defensive wounds are located over your legs and arms. After asking Aeria, she only asks for your forgiveness and hopes you will continue to participate in future gatherings. Asking your crew, the logs from that evening indicate there was an alarm across your fleet as the Solvernia suddenly engaged weapons, locking onto your flagship. Thankfully it disengaged after a few hours. Inquiring further might be dangerous to your health, and you decide to let sleeping dogs lie.
OR
""I wish to thank you, $playerName."" She says during your tea visit. ""I have never had someone who I valued like family before. You know full well my place and position, and I value your loyalty. Believe me when I say you are one of my most treasured companions, $playerName. Though this galaxy may be vast, and our homes surrounded by perils, I pray that when you grow old and weary, as we all inevitably do, you will find a small place of solace and find peace in these turbulent times."" She looks at you, like a mother looking at their own child. ""You will always be welcome here."" You let the moment pass in silence, unsure of what to say at first. 
""Thank you. For being with me.""

Your words linger as you take your leave. 
OR
When next you enter the office with the familiar scents and sounds you have become accustomed to, something catches your eye. On Aeria’s desk sits a small plushie doll, about ten centimeters in height. Its eyes were of chromatic thread, and hair of sky blue, dressed regally in an outfit befitting the Permaisuri.

""Ah! I see you noticed it. Is it not wonderful?"" Aeria asks in delight. ""They call it my mini-me."" Her eyes gleam as she looks at it. You wonder if she can perhaps rebuild her collection in due time.
OR
On a routine visit to New Auroria…

""$playerName! It is good to see you!"" She stands to receive you, guiding you toward a nearby table. She gestures to the small silver box at the table’s center, about five centimeters in width and about ten in length.  ""I finally finished tuning the strings!""

Excited as she lifts the lid, a wondrous melody escapes beckoning you closer. It was a soft tune, full of complex notes. The silver swan sculpture within was exquisite, with detailed ripples of water frozen in time rippling beneath its stretching wings. Hope, sorrow, bitterness, relief, you had never heard a song quite like it. As the music box plays, the two of you stand there listening to the soundscape, transfixed. You almost fail to notice her sobs. You place a hand on her shoulder, as the tune continues flying into the air, on and on.
OR
""$playerName, I am glad that we have been able to survive, and even thrive, here."" She says after sharing some biscuits with you. ""Though we all dearly miss our home, I am thankful that we still have hearths to give us shelter."" Perhaps, the Aurorans will return one day. Perhaps she might even live to see it.",,

After a moment of contemplation, the entire bridge is suddenly filled with an almost-blinding white light, stunning the entire bridge crew. Fortunately, everyone managed to shield their eyes in time. ""Ah, my apologies, I thought of something just now,"" Solvernia said, her face flushed with embarrassment. Apparently, she had accidentally triggered one of her floodlights.

""That idea being I could, somehow, try to convince the higher-ups and my fellow colleagues. Propose that I might gain invaluable experience by going out there if I'm allowed to tag along with you unofficially."" She thought to herself out loud while browsing through your personal files over her holopad. ""Besides, you've proven yourself to be quite a useful ally, not only to me, but also to others in the Federation.""

Then you also casually mentioned the endless donut delivery to her.

""W-well, even a woman like me must have her secrets, alright? Be a dear and get me those donuts would you?"" Once again, you were left with more questions than answers. You wished you could press her and get those answers out but out of the corner of your eye you notice the nearest 808mm rail cannon angle ever so slightly towards your ship.

The smiling android looked just like any other Neuko bot that you've encountered. Her appearance imitated the look of a tribal huntress. This one sported a different color scheme and decorative parts, lacking any military gear typically found on her other kin. Her artificial silicone body was made in white and blue with black accents and a pinkish flowery pattern. Her colorful cat-like headgear also proudly plays the iconic 'Queen's Hope' theme, which is softly audible if you listen for it.",,

The whole region was closed off to the public to allow for extensive construction efforts to take place, developing the uninhabited island into a trade hub - and finally, it’s open to the public!"" Narumi explained as she handed over a colorful pamphlet to you.

""Please note that it is still in its early development stage and only features local commodities and amenities for now, such as locally produced high-quality supplies, homebrewed anti-matter fuel, and more for your starfaring needs! Our ambassadors are currently working hard to encourage both local entrepreneurs and foreign allies to establish their trade posts here. Maybe somewhere in the future, you might see more shops opening up!""

Narumi then took a moment to process your identification code. After confirming your identity a second time, she points her finger towards the other end of the island, away from the public zone. ""Additionally, you might be interested in visiting our newly established naval research hub. I heard they're looking for an experienced starfarer who might be interested in trying out some prototype equipment and vessels on their behalf in exchange for real-time data and feedback.""

""... That being said, please be on the lookout for a possible infiltrator. A certain monopolizing fuel producer might be interested in knowing more about our secret fuel production recipes and may disguise themselves as a human-sized, blue lobster mascot.""

The cheerful android smiles and gestures to hand over your TriPad to her. You oblige and trust her not to do anything but confirm the transaction. God knows what kind of information is contained in that tripad of yours, as it may even jeopardize the very status quo of the Persean Sector itself. You start to sweat, and the seconds feel like minutes. The Neuko in front of you seems to be taking her sweet time processing the payment... until she breaks the awkward silence.

""Ah, my apologies, starfarer-san. I was just verifying with the trade hub's official staff regarding the current currency exchange rate and prices. The transaction went through successfully, and you're now officially a member of the trade hub community - Welcome~!"" Narumi returns the TriPad to you and puts the blank card in front of her slightly opened artificial lips. She softly blows onto the empty card as it slowly transforms into a brand new, colorful card with your very own name and insignia on it. There's even a personalized Neuko signature and bar code on the other side of the card too.

""Please accept this green tier keycard too as our welcoming gift."" She bows and hands over another card to you, which you graciously accept.

You can’t help but wonder and ask if she really needed to do all that to the card. She simply giggled and backed off a single step. ""Nope, I heard humans appreciate these kinds of interactions, and I was programmed to learn and give it a try. In fact, you are my first customer!"" Narumi said in a happy tone.
