You can no longer free repair during combat, there is a limited regeneration based on 40%/30%/25%/15% percentage of total ship HP. Its only activatable after zero-flux as there also are 3 ~ 5 seconds delay after it too.

17/11/2023

 It does no longer require a ship system to swap ammunition, instead relying on ship flux to do so. Currently capped at 50%.

Kaysaar have changed how Confectionary works now.
Food  = size of market ( for example size 6 market will generate 6 demand for food ) 
Domestic Goods = size of market - 2 
Heavy Machinery = size of market 
Adjust - Now deficit of any commodity needed by confectionary won't cause full stop of production but rather it's reduction by amount of units missing in demand section 

Supply Section
Choco Lava Cake = 2 + size of market 
Chocolate Donut Bundle 1 + (size of market -3)
Croissant and Pretzel Box 1 + (size of market - 5) : Here calculation is done so on size 3 and 4 worlds it will produce 1 unit of croissant and only after crossing size 5 it will increase production 

Added Monthly generation of bakery goods to player's storage
For this example supply here will be max of what you can have on size 6 world with 10 stability (without including ai cores)
Max size of market  = 6 
Max stability = 10 
Divider = (Max size - current market size)+(Max Stability - current stability) -> Divider lowest value will always be 1 
Production unit of Choco Lava Cake = 40
Production unit of Chocolate Donut Bundle = 30
Production unit of Croissant and Pretzel Box = 20
Calculation  (supply * productionUnit)/divider

Examples : 
Choco Lava Cake = (840)/1 = 320 monthly
Chocolate Donut Bundle = (430)/1 = 160 monthly
Croissant and Pretzel Box  = (2*20)/1 = 20 monthly

Nerfed effects of confectionary market upkeep reduciton to be from 80% on max to 35% (instead of mult of 0.2 you got mult of 0.75)
Nerfed effects of confectionary market income multiplier to be 50% less of what used to be
