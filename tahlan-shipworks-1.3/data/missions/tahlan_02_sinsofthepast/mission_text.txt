Location: The edge of Kassadari space
Date: 102.X.X

Kassadar lies in ruins. Just over a century since the collapse shattered the small group of planets that had once been under the noble rule of the Great Houses, only Kassadar remains, barely capable of feeding its people and those who managed to flee there as their own colonies starved without support from beyond the gates.

The Kassadari navy took heavy losses in the early years after the collapse, defending its realm from those who sought to claim it as faction small and large began making their claims on parts of the sector. Eventually the efforts stopped and the sector at large forgot about Kassadar, but the damage was done. Without their mining worlds, there was no way for the Houses to restore the fleets to their former glory and all that was left was maintenance with whatever resources could be spared.

80 years had passed since the last armed conflict in Kassadari space when patrol fleet Karda Secundus picked up unknown signatures on course towards Kassadar. What seemed like the first contact with raiders or scavangers in decades would soon prove to be shadow of the far past and patrol fleet Karda Secundus the only chance to prevent the annihilation of Kassadar.
