You don't understand (nor do you want to), but one of your bridge crew who happens to be a rabid follower of Westernesse media (un)helpfully explains Sweet_Sugar_Bath is the Peak Switch streamer on the Westerness Relay of significant importance, a position of some importance or 'Hotness'. You feel the analogy to radioactivity is ample as the officer explains that submission of credits to this Switch person is matter of life or death amongst Switch Subs, with greater credit sacrifices enabling them to rise to greater tiers of importance in the Sub hierarchy. Killing the target will enable this man to rise to greater levels of interaction with Sweet_Sugar_Bath, enhancing their prestige.\n\n Apparently.\n\n The money is bad, the return is terrible, and getting involved in this makes your skin crawl uncomfortably under your suit - but credits are credits.",

I'll just outlast you, just like how I'll outlast all those other posers who think that mistress Sugar is anything but a divine goddess!\"\n\nThe comms link goes off, as your eyes track across your bridge like a PD sensor, singling out the officer fuming in the corner, mumbling vaguely about \"ungrateful sub\" and \"not even worthy to hear her fart through a telephone\".\n\n\n\n They freeze as your glare pins him like a swarmer missile under a graviton beam, and mercifully they silence themselves.

To them, everyone else is a Hollowman, a soulless husk that is used by a puppet of the Rex Mundi.

Some, however, are real people blinded by the Rex Mundi, and their souls can be saved through an extensive process involving torture, coercion  and mind-altering drugs. If, after being tested on their faith and loyalty to ==Daniel Gentle== they prove devout, they too join the Cult. If they do not, then they are treated little worse than slaves, often executed by being thrown out the airlock during a sermon aboard the ==Good Ship Gentle==.\nFor the most part the Gentle Family stayed too far away from the core systems to even register on the major polity radar, however recently ==Daniel Gentle== has been moving closer and closer to the Core, with the aim of attacking Gilead. There, he will ascend to heaven along with his followers, and the Sector will be purged for their grevious sins.\n\nThe Luddic Church, not particularly wanting a crazed lunatic at the head of a giant fleet attacking what might be the most sacred site to the Luddic Faith, has posted a bounty for the Family's destruction - a bounty enhanced by survivors of the Gentle Family's cruelties.",

Or are you here to test your faith?\"\nHe leans forward, smile bright and soft, \"I don't mind either way, the Family treats everyone with kindness. And when you've passed on from your own foolishness in testing our faith, we'll be sure to show far more hospitality to the survivors of your pride. Anyone can join the Family, and be welcomed amongst our brothers and sisters - if their soul is true and faith strong. Rejoice, sisters and brothers! Your salvation from the Rex Mundi is come!\"",
