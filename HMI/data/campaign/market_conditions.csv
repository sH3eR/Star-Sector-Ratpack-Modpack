Haunted World,haunted,TRUE,,com.fs.starfarer.api.impl.campaign.econ.WorldArid,"Widely rumoured to be the site of a failed Tri Tachyon Psi ops experiment, Samiel's oceans are a deep blood red-orange colour due to, ostensibly, a rampant population of microorganisms. The fact that workers readily converting the mass into more suitable organics often have a high accident rate or commit suicide on a disturbingly regular basis is often ignored, as are the whispers often heard coming from the red depths of the ocean.",graphics/icons/markets/hmi_haunted.png,9200
Crystalline World,crystal_world,TRUE,,com.fs.starfarer.api.impl.campaign.econ.WorldJungle,"A world covered in rich, complex crystalline flora and fauna, the surface of this planet is ripe full of scientific discovery…and rich in materialistic resources.",graphics/icons/markets/hmi_crystalline.png,9201
Distant Polity,distantpolity,TRUE,,data.campaign.econ.DistantPolity,"Many planets in this area face tough challenges when it comes to resupply. The tyrany of distance, piracy and beaurocracy often reduces the ease at which these outer settlements can access Core markets. However, these markets are often used to these disruptions, often functioning for long periods without resupply or indeed any friendly contact.",graphics/icons/markets/outpost.png,9203
Smuggler Network,hmi_smugglernetwork,TRUE,,data.campaign.econ.HMISmugglerPolity,"With the complete breakdown of centralized control in Obsidian, smugglers have found an incredible opportunity to fuel the continued anarchy.",graphics/icons/markets/pirate_moot.png,9203
Hardened Polity,hardpolity,TRUE,,data.campaign.econ.HardenedPolity,"Opuntia is a hard place to exist. Constant Mess attacks interrupt shipping and require a constant dedication of patrols to fight it back. However, in the wake of these attacks is riches in metals, fuel and Mass. This continual war, of boom and bust, means this polity is very resiliant to lacking supplies. Further, continual Mess attacks have necessitated a greater dedication to defense. Making attacks against Cactorum is frought with danger, both from Mess attacks as well as the embedded defenses.",graphics/icons/markets/outpost.png,9203.5
Mess Infested,hmi_mess_swarm_cond,TRUE,,data.campaign.econ.MessSwarm,"This planet is currently infected by the Mess. Nanite swarms flow over the landscape, devouring useful elements, before collecting in grey bubbles to be collected by harvester drones, which are in turn collected and sent to the main hive in orbit. The environment is hazardous to everything man-made, and cannot be suppressed by any method known to current understanding of science. Colonising this place would be an effort in futility.",graphics/icons/markets/hmi_nanite.png,9202
Luddic Majority,hmi_eva_majority,TRUE,TRUE,data.campaign.econ.MysteryLuddicMajority,"Stability is improved if $market is controlled by a Luddic faction, otherwise it is reduced. Due to physiological irregularities combined with an aescetic ethos, the demand for illegal drugs is drastically reduced.",graphics/icons/markets/luddic_majority.png,142
