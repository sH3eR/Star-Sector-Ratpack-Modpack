$id == hmi_samiel","AddText""As you step off your ship, you are greeted by an unnervingly chipper port attendant, who hands you a data slate of the current inventory, before politely reminding you to wear a rebreather at all times. Befuddled by the fact they are not wearing one, and that she regularly turns to speak to people who are not there, you continue into the concourse. The area is full of drab run down stalls run by apathetic, empty eyed peddlers selling vials of the hallucinogenic Red Water. The sound of rhythmic pounding of pumping machines rumble from deep within the walls is covered by the cries of crew desperately bargaining with incoming captains to escape from this place, the muttered rumbling of those talking to themselves, or the hiss and click of rebreathers. Even through your own rebreather you can smell salt, produced from the refining of Red Water - clearly your rebreather is not up to snuff. The floor is covered in a thin layer of rubbish and red-brown stains, bathed in flickering fluorescent lighting. Continuing further into the concourse towards the administration area you enter a red-tinged atrium, a glass wall overlooking the ocean of crimson below. The sight is deeply unnerving, although you cannot explain why - until it occurs to you that you espy the regular motion of waves on the ocean, despite there being no atmosphere. The data slate blames the effect on the surface tension being held together by the organic mass within the ocean, which only puts you mildly at ease. Amongst the background noise of the pumping machines you swear you hear the sound of breaking waves, washing on a dead grey beach, and maybe...just maybe...the voice of a Mother you never met. You quickly resolve to get your business done as quickly as possible, before you get too addled by the fumes of the Red Water.""",,,

All that is left is a labyrinth of the geometric shapes of structural supports holding up the exterior structure. Deeper exploration of the hulk reveals a circular core made of some thick, white, impenetrable material. Several hatches and entrances into the core are sealed shut, and all the access panels, if remaining, are completely fried. The only clue to the origin of the station lies on the reverse side of a metal panel covering a fried access station, spared whatever force stripped out this place.

Here and there green robed monks stroll in silent prayer around the slow and gentle activity of the public. Glass-fronted convenience stores hide behind primitive automobiles, all under a network of cables criss-crossing over the streets between the short apartment blocks. You feel like you're in an archaeolog of primitive Earth. At nearly every street corner and every entrance is a statue of Saint Eva the Exultant. The general public appear to be afflicted with some sort of strange albinism that turns their hair blue or white, eyes a dull red, and skin an alabaster.

The smooth curves of the station however are ruined by newer, cruder  modular hab blocks and extensive bays to facilitate the transfer of volatile material from Metatron below. The concourse is comparatively bare, however - most deals occur elsewhere, and here the transport of materials is already established in one of the many other hangars. A chipper, purple-haired and red-eyed albino in a conservative green dress greets you as you disembark, and hands you a clipboard with all the standing contacts on station.

Your ship detects faint readings from the slender structures, possibly decay from an old fission reactor finally giving out, or maybe accumulated extrastellar radiation from centuries of exposure. 

When your $shipOrFleet is close enough to establish visual contact, the delta-class AI in charge of analysing the sensor data starts reporting increased energy readings from the core of the station itself. At the same time your sensor officer contradicts the report saying the station is a dead hulk, like many others before it.

Interestingly, when the stray round from fighting shattered the station, it appears to have gone straight through some strange, exotic-looking structure at the core, linked up to a treasure trove of low-grade AI cores. While acquiring the surprise bounty, your nervous salvage team locates a server encased in sturdy plasteel connected to the bizarre AI core network. The outer shell is partially destroyed, with the physical server storage inside mostly intact.

On downloading the contents of the server and analysing the data, you finally discover what just happened. Apparently, a secret Tri-Tachyon project was looking into mind control and had set up in this abandoned research station before the First AI War. They discovered that a combination of subliminal messaging, hypnotics, implant hacking, and several other vaguely mentioned pieces of ominous technology could be used to provide an aggressive form of mind control. The overall idea was to hack the target's comms, sensor and life support systems and cause enemy fleets to turn against themselves in paranoid delusion and hallucination. However, at some point the project was terminated - why is not clear. There are some references to vaguely mentioned technology used by the apparatus causing an 'Instrumentality Event', which you believe is the possibility of a beta level, or even an alpha level AI core taking over the mind control system and turning the researchers against themselves.

Nevertheless, while the project was ostensibly shut down, this station was left dormant for future usage in something called the 'Seele Project' with the mind control system set to self-defence. Your $shipOrFleet had fallen prey to this defense system; it was not some ghost ship you were fighting, but in fact it was your $shipOrFleet tearing itself apart! That lucky stray round had destroyed a key component of the mind control system, and with its demise the mind control effects were lifted.
