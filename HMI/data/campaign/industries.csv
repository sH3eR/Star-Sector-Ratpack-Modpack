The simplistic procedure however, may more charitably be refered to as crude and haphazard, requiring constant input of heavy machinery and crew to function.",9202

Nevermore Station is particularly unique as the main production line is a result of an activated  synchrotron, which has become entrenched into the station infrastructure itself like a weed. This prevents the synchrotron from being removed without destroying the station - something which in turn would also destroy the synchrotron.",1800

The Church of Eva believes that the remnants of Mercy's high technology aren't man made, instead it is divine machinery come from heaven and perverted by human hands. Consequently the Church has no issue with using said high technology as long as it is in service of cleansing Mercy of outsiders. This includes a small heavy machinery and fuel production operation, but most egregious to standard Luddic Path practice is their use of high-technology ships. The Church of Eva will only openly patrol as long as Soul is in the hands of the Luddic Path and this structure remains intact.",9203

Amongst these craters and holes hide the private hangars of privateers and freebooters, either down on their luck or just starting out on their less than legal mercenary life.",3803
