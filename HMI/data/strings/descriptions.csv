sml_fragrifle,WEAPON,"The HK-101 Precision Survey Pike is primarily used to fire survey probes into asteroids for more accurate information regarding asteroid composition. In combat  it's a superbly accurate, if somewhat underwhelming semi-automatic weapon. On contact the probes can emit a sharp, confusing burst of EMP that can disrupt engines and weapons on impact.",Fire Support,,
sml_shotgrun,WEAPON,"This medium-ranged shotgun is something of a frontiersmen favourite for hunting [REDACTED]. Has a poorer damage efficiency when compared with it's main rival, the dual autocannon.",Assault,,
rangus_crossbow,WEAPON,"The Rangus Crossbow Autocannon is a straightforward miniaturization of the Arbelest, adjusted to fit in a small ballistic mount. Sacrifices were made to range, turret traverse rate and recoil, but it still functions as a cheaper alternative to the railgun.",Anti-Shield,,
hmi_kiddie_mortar,WEAPON,"The Vince Kidney Mortar (colloquially 'Kiddie' Mortar) is a slap-dash modification of the light mortar. With the reload and firing mechanism replaced, this weapon can fire a short burst of mortar rounds at high speed, but takes considerable time to reload with free rounds. Useful for strikes against unshielded hull.",Strike,,
hmi_nailgun,WEAPON,"The Silesia Nailgun is an old riveting tool used to pin station supports to asteroids and geological features. In combat the safeties are disabled and the weapon fires molten rivets at the enemy in short bursts over acceptable ranges with decent flux efficiency. The molten fragments themselves lack punch against armour and shields, but will cut through armour-stripped hull in seconds.",General,,
rock_launcher,WEAPON,"The Lesser Xin Li Mining Collector uses localised gravitronic fields similar to artificial gravity on ships to grab small asteroids - or fling small objects like bundled mining explosives at the enemy. While the weapon has long range, it is let down by a slow projectile, and the civilian explosive that splatters harmlessly against shields.",Suppression,,
retro_ml,WEAPON,"A low powered mining laser retrofitted for ballistic slots. Due to the ballistic integration, the weapon works by depleting manually loaded energy cores in short bursts. The process of reloading the cores is slow and sluggish, but the rapid depletion of the core provides a surprising amount of firepower. Lacks the ability to track missiles, but works as a semi-effective anti-fighter weapon.",Anti-Fighter,,
burst_ml,WEAPON,"The Chimobuko configuration of the mining laser utilises better lensing to extend the reach of the mining laser. This extension weakens the beam considerably, however it does enable remote gravitation manipualtion of small objects. While this weapon will struggle to kill a missile or fighter in combat situations, it will disrupt its flight plan enough for other weapons to deal with it.",Point Defense,,
mining_gen,WEAPON,"This assembly, under mining conditions, fires a stream of magnetic nanites that seek out ores, which are then sucked back into the assembly. In combat the assembly is rotated 90 degrees to the side and overcharged. When released from the emergency vent port, the resulting blast of charged nanites can cripple ship systems and overload even mid-grade shielding. The intense conditions put tremendous strain on the assembly, ensuring the weapon can only be used once or twice before suffering a critical malfunction.",Strike, ,
hmi_slagger_gun,WEAPON,"This weapon heats asteroid matter to unstable levels for future refining. In combat it fires this slag in short spurts. Near heavy matter it explodes, distributing the heat into the target. The short range of the heated material prevents effective anti-ship combat, but the wildly unpredictable slag can effective clear small regions of missiles.",Point Defense,,
kane_missile,WEAPON,"Considered to be an 'upgrade' of the Hammer torpedo, the Kane torpedo has very weak tracking capability while maintaining the same damage output as the Hammer. Mostly used by old dodgers with poor eyesight.",Strike,,
seth_sml,WEAPON,"A hacked drone construction assembler crudely applied to a missile slot, this weapon is able to release a slow but steady stream of Seth Drones; slow, dumb borer drones that burst apart into a small number of kinetic fragments when nearing enemy ships.",Fire Support,,
mbeke_sml,WEAPON,"A turret that shoots a steady stream of low-yield warheads, the Mbeke Rocket Turret is considered to be an outdated if rather useful weapon to pressure enemy ships. An autoloader sustains its ability to pressure targets in longer engagements.",Suppression,,
mbeke_fighter,WEAPON,"A smaller derivative of the Annhiliator, the Ngolo releases a steady stream of low yield rockets. Restricted by a limited ammo pool and slow firing rate.",Suppression,,
signpost_sml,WEAPON,"A simple seismic mining charge, the Signpost vibrates and destabilises particularly thick regions of geology for future accumulation. In combat these charges are launched over long range to suppress the enemy. However, due to safety measures and easy dispersal by shields, the charge only properly activates on sudden contact with armour.",Anti-Armour,,
,,,,,
hmi_ragtime,WEAPON,"The Ragtime Mortar is an attempt to improve upon the Heavy Mortar. With an extended barrel and a reinforced reloading mechanism, the Ragtime can fire slightly quicker and hit with marginally better consistency than the Heavy Mortar, but loses out on some flux efficiency.",Anti Armour,,
launcher_cannon,WEAPON,"The Greater Xin Li Mining Collector uses localised gravitronic fields similar to artificial gravity to grab moderate asteroids. While these fields are too weak to affect ships in combat, they can propel a small clutch of mining explosives at the enemy. These projectiles are easily defeated by shields, but can be fired with good flux efficiency.",Suppression,,
med_frag_mg,WEAPON,"This weapon is deeply loved by Gunnery Officers for rewarding the proper upkeep of its overly complicated and many reduntant systems, liked by Starship Captains who like to eliminate swathes of fighters, and loathed by gunnery crews for using an archaic liquid cooling system that requires constant attention and continual upkeep.",Suppression,, 
twotherac,WEAPON,"By removing the central rifle of the Heavy Autocannon, it becomes much easier to compensate for successive shots from a single turret. The result is the Two-Third (Toother) Autocannon, with better accuracy and longer range, at the cost of lower damage output.",Anti-Shield,,
clyde_mg,WEAPON,"Affectionately known as the Tommy Gun, this weapon fires a continuous stream of kinetic bullets at the enemy. Unfortunately let down by an old rechambering mechanism, which rapidly builds flux on use.",Assault,,
pumm_mg,WEAPON,"Techmined from some forgotten archaeological site, this derivative of the Thumper has a smaller magazine, but a larger caliber bullet and is able to track missiles. Able to fire short bursts at mid-range, this weapon is useful for anti-fighter and point-defense applications.",Point Defense,,
hmi_voracious,WEAPON,"This monster of a techmined weapon unleashes a torrent of armour-piercing projectiles downrange with terrifying accuracy for moderate flux efficiency. However, the weapon is limited by it's magazine and slow reload, relegating it to a strike weapon.",Close Support,,
retro_mb,WEAPON,"A mining blaster retrofitted for a medium ballistic slot, this mining implement is deceptively powerful. While lacking the punch a mining blaster normally possesses due to a dependance on manually loaded energy cores, the better containment of the lower energy bolts results in a more flux-efficient weapon.",Assault,,
mcg_ml,WEAPON,"A frankenstein design from a legendary technician, this battery of overcharged mining lasers releases a burst of unfocused, short range beams that can demolish armour, but are easily turned aside by shields and lack the ability to properly disrupt hull structure.",Assault,,
suowang_pulser,WEAPON,"A primitive variation of the Autopulse Laser, the Suo Wang Pulser shoots a rapid stream of IR laser bursts as long as its capacitors allow. Considered to be an effective assault weapon for light craft.",Strike,,
double_ir,WEAPON,"A relatively simple weapon, the Double IR Pulse Laser is exactly what it says on the tin - two IR pulse lasers combined into a single slot. The size of the doubled assembly requires the usage of a medium energy mounting, however it is still a useful and flux efficient weapon for assault craft.",Assault,,
hmi_mininglaser_array,WEAPON,"Three upsized Mining Lasers in an array, this asteroid cutting and accumulation device doubles as a cheap but weak anti-missile and suppression weapon.",Point Defense,,
seth_med,WEAPON,"Two hacked borer drone construction assemblys crudely applied to a missile slot, this weapon is able to release a slow but steady stream of Seth Drones with improved, longer range engines and implanted explosive devices. On close range, the drones burst apart and shoot the explosive charges at the enemy.",Fire Support,,
campbelltown_med,WEAPON,"More a threat to friendly vessels than to enemy ships, this weapon releases a wide spread of light rockets. For this reason its use has all but disappeared, apart from several crazy miscreants from beyond the Outer Rim who still say its useful as a strike weapon.",Strike,,
mbeke_med,WEAPON,"The Mbeke Rocket Rack launches short bursts of long-range, low yield missiles. While individual missiles lack punch, they can be worrying for lighter targets and armour stripped hulls, and can be massed quite effectively. An autoloader sustains its pressuring potential.",Suppression,,
signpost_med,WEAPON,"A larger Signpost Launcher, this weapon is a useful for long range suppression. On detonation on hull, the target's armour will be destabilized by intense vibration, weakening the foe for additional follow-up attacks.",Anti-Armour,,
rad_gun,WEAPON,"A horrifyingly inhuman machine, this weapon shoots a stream of concentrated high energy particles and subspacial anomalies in a brief beam that turns unprotected targets into molten, screaming goo. The saving grace of this weapon is it's absurdly high ordinance cost, meaning it's not in use everywhere - little hope for those facing it, however.",Suppression,,
mining_burst_blaster,WEAPON,"A modification of the Mining Blaster to utilize a rotary system similar to the Thumper, this weapon can deal reliable damage to enemy hull but is notoriously flux intensive.",Strike,,
,,,,,
dick_cannon,WEAPON,"A weapon extracted from what may have been a Pre-Domain weapons facility, this artillery assembly fires a considerable stream of ordinance. While it has a short range and fires weak fragmentary projectiles similar to oversized vulan rounds, the high-speed turret motors and sheer volume of fire ensure it has a niche use as combination point defence and assault weapon.",Point Defense,,
mark_iv,WEAPON,"With a cripplingly shallow ammo pool and slower reload speed, this progenitor of the Mark IX is widely considered to be obsolete despite its better accuracy and longer range. However, with investment into magazine expansion, this weapon becomes an somewhat effective close support weapon.",Close Support,,
hmi_megalauncher_cannon,WEAPON,"The Xin Li Mining Accumulator uses localised gravitronic fields similar to artificial gravity on ships to manipulate large volumes of smaller asteroids. In combat it's used to manipulate small mining charges at the enemy, producing a field of explosions that can wipe missile and fighter waves, while at least worry larger vessels.",Assault,,
tpc_hmi,WEAPON,"This halfway-successful attempt to replicate the Thermal Pulse Cannon in a modular form resulted in several key differences with the original weapon, with the ammo pool drastically reduced, accuracy compromised, range shortened and flux efficiency decreased. Despite these niggling factors making it closer to an oversized Heavy Blaster than an actual modular TPC, the weapon otherwise works as advertised.",Strike,,
hmi_heavy_assault_launcher,WEAPON,"The Baffler Area Denial Launcher is a simple weapon - it fires a large burst of unguided, low-yield bombs with basic proximity fuses across a conservative area. These bombs are large and slow moving, making them unique in that point defense weapons can target and detonate them. However, the launching mechanism is flux efficient and capable of projecting the bombs over long distances, although inaccurately.",Suppression,,
,,,,,
hmi_khorkoi_miningblaster,WEAPON,"This dumb-fire rocket was ubiquitous in the pre-Collapse Persean Sector due to applications pioneered by asteroid miners. The go-to strike weapon of the desperately under-equipped, the Hammer is often employed by poor independent militias, Pirates, and particularly the Luddic Path. This version, built directly into the hull of the Khorkoi, allows the crew to directly but slowly reload the weapon in battle.

This particular three-shot mount earned its name when some clever spacer figured out how to modify the civilian rack-cycler into a hull-jarring one-two-three salvo. The modification spread through the Sector seemingly overnight.",Strike,,
pumm_cannon,WEAPON,"An archaic derivative of the Gauss Cannon, this clumsy monstrosity is too large to use as a modular weapon and only effectively useable in specially designed mountings, such as the spinal mount of the Junk. On the battlefield, this beast deletes fighters and frigates with ease, and worries larger targets enough to give them a second thought.",Fleet Defense,,
swarmer_junk,WEAPON,"This derivative of the Swarmer SRM is usually built in to a station's infrastructure to continuously supply the weapon with ammunition. Further, the weapon itself fires additional missiles per burst, which move faster and pack additional explosive. An effective anti-fighter close support weapon, it is let down by the need for its integration into a station's infrastructure, and its unfortunate name.",Anti Fighter,,
marlinblaster,WEAPON,"The core of the Marlin, the Scarlet Aura Energy Blaster lies somewhere between a Heavy Blaster and a Pulse Laser in damage output, with much greater flux efficiency.",General Purpose,,
tpc_weaver,WEAPON,"The vast majority of the Weaver is built around this improved version of the Thermal pulse Cannon. Possessing a greater damage output and faster projectile speed, the Weaver Pulse Cannon is nevertheless let down by its limited ammo pool.",Suppression,,
domres_hellbore,WEAPON,"Two Hellbores slaved into a single turret, this station-bourne weapon can crush Capital grade armour with ease. Luckily it's ungainly bulk prevents it from being mounted on anything other than a station-based platform.",Suppression,,
khradeh_left,WEAPON,"A weapon built directly into the sub-structure of the Jakkle, the Khradeh Autocannon is a mid-ranged ballistic gatling gun. While it lacks punch due to flaws sabotaged into the ship design, the alteration resulted in a reduction in expected flux cost, making it a very flux efficient weapon.",General Purpose,,

,,,,,
blitz_suicide_drive,WEAPON,"The Reign Borer Drone is sent at high speed into the enemy. Due to all energy being sent to the thrusters, the drone is unable to reorientate on 'firing' itself. Damage is primarily caused through the kinetic mass of the drone striking the target.",Anti-Shield,,
bombardment_drone_suicide_drive,WEAPON,"The Bombardment Drone lives up to its name, and bombards itself into the enemy, wherein the explosives packed into hull of the fighter explodes. Crippling to armour, however shields can mitigate a substantial amount of the impact.",Anti-Armour,,
hmi_drill,WEAPON,"The Marx Drill is an effective instrument for the grinding, sorting and analysis of ore materials, ensuring its widespread use as a mining tool. Able to tear through geological astrogeology with great efficiency, there is little wonder then that it can also tear through ship armour with similar, if incredibly frightening efficiency. If, of course, it can get in range of the enemy.",Anti-Ship,, 
tpc_hmi_hvb,WEAPON,"A bulky energy weapon from an early epoch, this TPC has been tweaked to have a higher damage output and a greater ammunition capacity. Capable of a truly horrifying amount of overwhelming firepower.

Designed before modular energy weapons were universally trusted by Domain naval architects, this weapon was coded into the Onslaught's blueprint because no other hull of the time was large enough or had reactors capable of generating the requisite power.

Even though it's outperformed by some of the later epoch modular designs, the Thermal Pulse Cannon remains an integral part of the Onslaught's arsenal.",Assault,,

hmi_ascendante_hammer,WEAPON,"A weapon built into the Ascendante's spine, this weapon launches bursts of three light-weight Hammer torpedoes. The lighter weight means the torpedo moves faster and enables easy reloading, but the downside is the lighter torpedo packs a lighter punch and burns out faster.",Strike,,

On raiding the ship's cargo holds, only to reveal the ship was loaded with heavy trash and not high-value cargo, the main Privateer quickly said that this cutting edge design of a ship was the real prize. Needless to say said Privateer was shot out of the airlock, but the ship was kept, mostly as a mascot. Said mascot was, inexplicably, the only surviving craft after a later attack by the Luddic Path. Finding themselves in a cloud of debris in hostile space, the desperate crew reworked the ship into a semi-functioning combat vessel using parts found on the rapidly dispersing battlefield. Quickly they found exactly how amazing hardy, and how ridiculously modular the ship was, as they were able to attach more and more systems to the ship.

With the company at large unwilling to pursue an intensive legal matter over what could be argued to be an inferior Wolf design, the hull was consigned to obscurity.

This wouldn't resolve the economy of the ship, but would improve its versatility to the point where the cost could be justified. Hacking this design was very straightforward, however the resulting ship was incredibly sluggish and lacked the punch the Hammerhead possesses.

A running theory was the problem lay with the ring cloak being used singularly, and that if the ring cloak was doubled then the phase distortions could be tuned to inhibit emergent backwash. The result was an experimental craft made with two ring cloaks. Unfortunately this hackjob only slightly mitigated the phase emergence issue overall; poor management between the rings could cause sudden and unexpected spikes that often caused a worrying degree of brain trauma.

Normally this hackjob would be dismissed out of hand, except the double coil configuration enabled a startling increase in the mass that could be put into and out of p-space.

Regardless of its schizophrenic design, it is still a solid vessel if properly outfitted, that is regrettably let down by indeterminant errors in construction the kills the Calico's long-term performance in combat.

The design of the Calico was recovered interestingly enough from an archeaological dig investigating a Pre-Domain site. While sifting amongst old vidphones and vision screens, an anachronistic package was found which contained this design along with evidence of post-collapse technology. How this package managed to appear buried kilometers below the surface in a long-lost pre-Domain colony is a complete mystery, but it's sale to the Company more than covered the dig's expenses. The Calico is a combat carrier with a focus on very strong shields and ample flux capacitance to weather incoming fire, while using its fighter complement and weapon systems to destroy targets. While the design is uncorrupted and the components used in the ship's construction are not difficult to source, it is believed that there is something wrong with the design due to repeated issues with the ships subsystems that often require repairs to be repeated multiple times.",,,
ascendate,SHIP,"Packing a devastating built-in weapon and thick armour, this vessel is a solid line ship, but is let down by poor mobility. Further, due to parts of the design apparently being 'eaten' and requiring stop-gaps to fill in the missing parts, the craft is lacking long term performance.

Early in Haseo Fuyutsuki's career, he entered into a ship auction hoping to acquire an LPC for the Sunder for his budding Company. He bid on what he thought was the design he desired, but once the bidding had ended he discovered he had won the worn and apparently partially eaten LPC of the Ascendante. This makes the Ascendante rather novel as one of the few ship designs the company acquired through perfectly legitimate means - that can also be comfirmed by third parties, at least. The Ascendante is in many regards an up-armoured Sunder. A lot of the underlying infrastructure is similar, except there is considerably more armour and hull reinforcement applied to the ship. A generous weapons layout and a large built-in Rotary Hammer Launcher ensures that this brawler of a ship can deal a fair amount of punishment. However, the ship itself is painfully slow and due to the original LPC of the Ascendante being damaged, unexpected issues can arise rather quickly after prolonged engagement.",,,
prognosticator,SHIP,"The Prognosticator is an awkward light destroyer chassis due to its shape and size. This is because the ship is actually the accruments of starfaring wrapped around a top-secret, experimental engine. This mechanism, according to eye-witness reports, is able to cause target vessels to slow down in speed, fire rate and venting. Secretive testing of scavanged target ships appear to indicate some type of time dilation is involved. Consequently, despite appearing quite weak and vulnerable, this ship is a powerful support vessel, which should be eliminated at the earliest opportunity.",,,

scarecrow,SHIP,"A ship bourne of hubris turned into a beast of a heavy cruiser, the Scarecrow is a very big, very mean, very sluggish hackjob of an Eagle. Being a hackjob, the ship tends to break down the longer its in combat conditions.

The result of a rich Warlord wanting the have the biggest and best Eagle, the designs for the Scarecrow were stolen from the grip of his cold dead hands by ""Hazard"" Fuyutsuki himself. Unfortunately the design was not complete, and the various missing parts often resulted in the ship shearing in half if it moved too quickly. This ship has seen repeated design passes and refinements to try and make it into a somewhat functional vessel at the direction of Fuyutsuki as well - although whether he was interested in a heavy cruiser for the Company, or because he too wanted the biggest and best Eagle in the sector is unclear. With additional substructure reinforcement the ship was able to perform more high speed movement without cracking in two, and more weapons systems were integrated. At some point in the design process a fighter bay was added to the front to provide additional support, and later large ballistic mounts were integrated to give the ship more punch. The result is a very heavy cruiser with a generous weapons layout, let down by sluggish controls and several design issues that prevent the ship from seeing extended engagement.",,,
hippocampus,SHIP,"A Tri-Tachyon retrofit of the Gemini, this ship is designed primarily for exploration, but can work in a fire support role in a pinch.

Taking note of the rapidly changing situation in the Persean Sector, the Tri-Tachyon Corporation investigated an alternative to the Venture that could deal with the new chaotic realities they found themselves in. The culmination of this research was the Hippocampus, a modification of the Gemini with improved flux systems, a conversion to a more flexible weapons and flight deck loadout, and the inclusion of a very sophisticated range of photometric scanners, deep-terrain sensors and atmosphere characterisation equipment that drastically reduces the workload cost required to carry out a survey. The cost of the 'Hippo's attractive capabilities is a drastic loss in cargo space and relatively high logistical profile, requiring a sizeable investment in support vessels to support it.",,,
roach_king,SHIP,"A nigh-unkillable thug of a ship, the Roach King is strongly reinforced and heavily armed.

Originally a product of desperation, the original Roach King was devised as a stop-gap defensive vessel against Hazard Mining Incorporated. The desperate defenders of some now forgotten polity had taken a piece of their destroyed station, attached engines, weapons and assorted space junk, and used it as the flagship for their rag-tag fleet. Unfortunately this first vessel was lacking in maneuvering thrusters, and during the pivotal battle the ship ended up flying straight through the HMI formation and into the system's star. The HMI, however, saw the potential in weaponising otherwise useless station parts from their conquests, and thus the current iteration of the Roach King was born. Shockingly hardy, this ship can wither truly horrific amounts of damage and come back for more. Furthermore, if the ship were to somehow be destroyed, it can be reconstructed in more favourable and far more terrible forms. This ship however is notoriously sluggish, and regularly costs a pretty penny in repair costs.",,,
slugworth,SHIP,"The Slugworth is a surprisingly effective if lumbering heavy carrier, packing both ample fighter decks and mounts for close support armament.

The Mora is often used as the beginning of a colony or mining center on alien worlds, with the main structure buried in the ground and used as the basis of later colonial structures. On considering this, Company scavangers often try the reverse: taking a colony building, attaching engines to it, and attempting to use the building as a space-faring vessel. These makeshift ships almost always have mixed to poor results, never gaining a vessel designation according to official Hegemony Ship lists due to the floating buildings never lasting long enough in large enough numbers to be recognised. The single exclusion to this are vessels based on the Slugworth Organics Pumping Station, which are officially recognised as a class of cruiser. The Slugworth building was originally built to be modular for ease of transport, and be assembled in high corrosion and high pressure environments on otherwise toxic worlds. With very little alteration the structure could be converted into a resilient if sluggish carrier, something which many Company scavanger captains leap upon due to ease of acquisition from colony wreckage or simply constructing the 'ship' themselves. Due to the modular construction, it is incredibly easy to reassemble in case of destruction - with some choice alterations often added by discerning scavengers.",,,
sulemain,SHIP,"Graceful and elegant, the Sulemain is a very fast ship with a solid mix of ballistic and energy armament and very good flux stats. However, this above avergae combat performance comes with notorious supply costs and undermined long-term combat ability due to the discontinuity between different technologies.

Recovered from the ruins of a long-passed polity (and this time around, it actually was long passed), the Suleiman is an incomplete design. The core of the ship including engines, reactor, flight deck and some weapon mounts are intact, however large portions of the ship are missing from the blueprint either due to corruption or deletion. The intact regions are incredibly intriguing due to the presence of aberrant design features, like a large energy mount that is fitted into the roof of the hangar bay, and an incredibly efficient engine reactor. Hazard Mining, seeing the huge potential of this vessel, decided to simply hack on parts from other designs to the ship, producing a strange mish-mash of high tech excellence tempered by low tech stability. The product of this process is the Suleiman, a frighteningly aggresive heavy cruiser with good flux stats, a very good weapons layout, and a much covetted plasma jet system. While the design works as intended, the same discontinuity between high tech and low tech regions can result in problems during construction and repair, often requiring improvisation and ingenuity to keep the vessel running.",,,
weaver,SHIP,"An artillery gun with engines strapped on, the Weaver is a solid close support ship able to smash enemies quite effectively with it's Weaver TPC. However, being a weapon with engines strapped on rather than an actual ship, issues quickly emerge during combat which cuts its long-term performance off at the knees.

On investigating an old Domain-Era facility, the Company located a weapons system that was based on the Thermal Pulse Cannon. The design was a major improvement, with additional integrated weapons systems and truly astounding flux systems. These features, while primitive to Domain-Era technology, are miles ahead of current technology in the post-Collapse Persean sector, and thus the Company sought to turn this platform into a useable weapons system. However there was a key problem - the design was originally made to test the new Thermal Pulse Cannon and how it behaved with other weapons and shield systems 'in vacuo', and not for combat trials. The Company, not to be deterred, took the design, and hacked on engines and a reactor to the design to produce the Weaver. With very good combat stats, the ship suffers from poor movement and high maintenance, as the weapons systems were not designed to see combat.",,,
mora_pirates,SHIP,"This pirate modification of the Mora removes the internal Damper Field system, replacing the substructure with better weapon versatility and the ability to throw the engines into overdrive. The result is a far more aggressive vessel, with enough armour to protect it in outrageous maneuvers, and enough weaponry and fighter support to press the enemy during those maneuvers.

This class of carrier was commissioned during the same period of carrier-centric Domain naval doctrine as the ubiquitous Talon fighter. Armored to withstand the fury of battle alongside the Onslaught, the Mora was nonetheless decommissioned en masse as doctrine shifted to favor heavier guns and capital ships flanked by line-cruisers. 

Demilitarized hulls were sold and converted into mobile industrial platforms for use on the frontiers of the Domain. The rugged and eminently adaptable Mora was a common sight in long-range surveying, mining, construction, drone handling, and use as mobile drydocks. Some hulls were even half-buried on alien worlds and used as armored power-stations and workshops to form the core of new settlements.

After the Collapse, Mora hulls were re-militarized almost suspiciously rapidly by factions that did not possess dedicated fleet carriers. Today they are an anvil upon which many an unwary Pirate warlord is broken.",,,
fury_pirates,SHIP,"A brutal butchering of the Fury-class, this pirate modification includes a flight deck designed for close support and better shields.

A fast-attack high-tech light cruiser, the Fury is designed to choose when and where it strikes to inflict maximum effect upon the enemy. The specialized inbuilt plasma 'microburn' system allows the Fury to make small dashes at high speed to catch unwary opponents off-guard.

The Fury-class is the Shrike-classes big sibling, a product of the same design team asked to fulfill slightly updated requirements, including resolution of the longstanding hull corrosion issue without, it was hoped, introducing any new problems. This was largely successful (once the chaos of several indignant resignations was sorted out).

Dismissed by heavy-armor-ballistic-firepower traditionalists as 'just another small-bore glass cannon', the Fury has nonetheless proven quite dangerous in the hands of quick-thinking fleet commanders.",,,
dominator_hmi_p,SHIP,"Ponderous and menacing, this pirate hack-job of the Dominator-class consolidates the missiles into a single large mount and forgoes considerable rear-ward ordinance to focus on frontal assault.

While not the most technologically advanced hull, it relies on a plethora of ballistic hardpoints to accomplish its mission, which is more often than not defending orbital installations and vital points of intra-system trade routes. A poor shield emitter which is difficult to manage and thus, rarely engaged, gives way to an almost impregnable interlocking armor belt system making the Dominator safe from most weapons. Even strike craft cannot overcome the hail of projectiles that can be launched to intercept their payloads. This hull proves that tried and true military engineering is difficult to overcome by new ideas and technologies, especially when in the hands of tough, determined crews and experienced officers.

Dependable, durable, and a constant presence in home space around civilized worlds and outposts, the Dominator is perhaps most hated and feared by pirates and law-breaking corporate agents. ",,,

beldam,SHIP,"The largest member of the Shrike and Fury family, the Beldam is a fast-attack high-tech battlecruiser. With frightening mobility and a terrifying armament, the Beldam is capable of rapidly locating weaknesses in enemy battlelines and dash in to exploit them with the specialized inbuilt plasma 'microburn' system.

 While the Fury was well-received by crews for its mobility and firepower, the Beldam was not. Firstly, the longstanding hull corrosion issue caused by the plasma-induced 'microburn' that was solved in the Fury was walked back with the Beldam in order to maintain engine power. Secondly, the long hull is incredibly vulnerable to flanking maneuvres. Considering the ship's chassis was kept light in order to maintain mobility, exploiting weaknesses in enemy lines can be a dicey affair. Thirdly, the concentration of ordinance in the front makes navigating and upkeeping the vessel notorious amongst ship crews. 

Considered incredibly fragile and oversized by Hegemony analysts, the ship still packs a monstrous punch and is incredibly cheap to run, making it a solid option for medium patrols.",,,
junk,SHIP,"The Junk is one of the largest combat freighters in the Sector, however its design leans towards 'freighter' rather than 'combat'.

The original design of the Junk was widespread throughout the Domain some many, many, MANY cycles ago. Some say they were even rumoured to be precursors to the Gate Haulers of legend. What is apparent, however, is their large size, incredible bulk and terrible engine power meant they were quickly outclassed by comparatively smaller and more efficient designs, such as the Atlas. Thus the Junk was to be consigned to the history books - had a wreck and its incomplete plans not been discovered in an ancient Domain facility by Hazard Mining Incorporated. Now the well defined chasis is used as the framework for the attachment of many, many cargo pods, massive fuel tanks, large crew quarters, many weapon mounts, bits and pieces of salvaged ships, and even the integration of a weapon more at home on a defense satellite. Huge, lumbering and thickly reinforced, this vessel is able to fight off smaller pirate attacks all on its own.

Some say it was based on a rumoured pirate attempt to reverse engineer the Astral, while others say it was an aquatic mining vessel reconstructed in space, and yet others claim that it was simply a junker design that just happened to be functional. Regardless of the source, Hazard Mining Incorporated immediately acquired the design, as the ample weapon slots, large fighter bays and the simplicity of integrating mining and salvage equipment into the hull turned this ship into a versatile capital option. Able to rapidly strip mine ore sources with ease, provide a significant contribution to salvage, and swarm smaller fleets with its numerous fighter wings, the Fishkill is an incredibly effective support vessel.

Instead of a very long range, energy-based layout, the Herakles is focused on massed, accurate ballistic and missile firepower to make approaching the ship a grueling prospect. When the Hazard Mining Company encounted the Herakles, the ship was still in the prototypical stages and was not even spaceworthy when the pirate dock it was attached to was destroyed by the Company. Salvaging the pieces and reverse-engineering the design, along with implementation of other technologies similarly found by the Company, Hazard Mining was able to reconstruct the vessel and its LPC. Currently the Herakles is a somewhat uncommon sight in Company fleets; after all, it's often easier and cheaper to construct smaller junk ships or salvage an old ship, than it is to construct this dedicated battleship that suffers from severe degradation after its peak time expires due to the many conflicting technologies at work in the ship.

What makes this vessel particularly dangerous is its movement system which, after a brief period of preparation, accelerates the ship at high speed towards the enemy - a feature which catches other captains by complete surprise. 

When first launched from orbital dock, they must have surely dwarfed any other ship in existence and intimidated entire systems. Some even say that they were built to combat non-humans in a long forgotten war. Much later, Domain engineers made modifications to the blueprints to include a shield system, upgraded the FTL drives, and reduced the necessary crew complement through automation and iterative engineering. Even though more advanced blueprints are available, the Onslaught remains the easiest to manufacture due to the brutal simplicity of its systems. 

A ship designed without shields in mind, built to be able to withstand a heavy barrage of enemy fire and strike back while protecting its crew is much loved by its officers and crew.

A rather rare vessel, the Ecstacy-class cruiser is a ridiculously expensive but very effective option in the Tri-Tachyon product catalogue. Its exorbitant cost reflects its excellence in combat situations - oppressive energy weapon mountings, two autonomous bays for drone fighters, stunning performance statistics and frightening mobility make it a considerable threat on the battlefield. Even though it was designed for Tri-Tachyon's shareholders as a technology showcase model never meant for actual production and use in combat, the artificial intelligence in control of manufacturing such a ship clearly did not care about human concepts such as money or financial viability.

How is a complete mystery; did the station's manufactory glitch, producing the nanite mass? Was this a secret isolation facility for nanite mass which broke containment? Or was this station infected later as a part of a horrifyingly unknown method of transmission? Regardless of how this station came to be overcome, it has not yet established itself thoroughly in the system. It lacks the intense magnetic and nanite swarm field surrounding the station, which means this station is considerably more vulnerable than the Mess object in Opuntia, and might actually be destroyable - with considerable investment of capital-grade firepower, of course.",,,

hmi_limina,SHIP,"An AI-designed ship, this vessel is fast, aggressive in its loadout, and possesses a unique hull repair system that regenerates hull when actively venting. However, the shield generator is substandard, the hull fragile, and armour nearly nonexistant. The Limina has the potential to be an incredibly dangerous ship that rewards high-risk piloting in the hands of an experienced captain.

Discovered buried in the wreckage of the Mess-Infested Remnant station, this ship is unusual in a variety of ways. The ship itself appears to be based on a Coelum class, except far lighter and faster. Further, the vessel utilises nanomachine Deep Dream generators to repair hull on the process of actively venting flux, enabling it regenerate terrifying amounts of damage on retreating from high-intensity combat situations. The strangest thing of all is the craft possesses all the utilities and interfaces necessary for a human crew to run and maintain the vessel. 

Data extracted from the ship's computers indicate that this vessel exists due to the Mess-afflicted AI becoming glitched, and attempting to finish the Coelum project to satisfy an urgent demand by Tri-Tachyon Security. On completion, the AI stored the finished ship, and the ship was then consumed by the Mess, causing the degraded AI to note that it was behind on the demand by Tri-Tachyon Security, and attempt the project again, building on what had already been made before. It is unclear how many times this may have happened, with the craft being consumed and remade over and over again, but the product of this aggressive and repetitive AI-enforced engineering evolution is the Limina. Nimble and terrifying, it is let down by an incredibly bad shield efficiency and poor hull integrity, both of which are a product of the nanite Deep Dream generators aboard - shields interfere with the nanite regeneration procedure, and rapidly nanite-repaired hull tends to be less structural stable than standard reinforced hull.",,,

HMI,FACTION,"Many cycles ago, a daring space miner called Haseo 'Hazard' Fuyutsuki set out into the Outer Rim to make his fortune with nothing but a Shepherd, some loose change and a dream. Today, the Company he founded holds an iron grip beyond the Core Worlds, always seeking more profit. Made up of adventurers, freebooters and mercenaries, Hazard Mining Incorporated is well known as a company where anyone can make their fortune. It is also well known for being rather... unethical in the acquisition of goods, luxuries and tech from the Outer Rim colonies. The Luddic Church often demands the destruction of the 'Soulless Machine', and other established factions are rendered nervous by the accusations of briganditry, banditry, protection racketeering, and possibly even genocide. But while the Company continues to churn out absurdedly high profits and an endless supply of raw goods, the major factions remain placated...for now...",,,
knights_of_eva,FACTION,"The Knights of Eva Exultant is a very insular religious group that is obsessed with maintaining control of the Mercy system. This religious group was started in response to a traumatic cataclysm in Mercy at some point after the Collapse, which they hold the Tri-Tachyon Corporation responsible for. The survivors of this disaster were banded together by Saint Eva, a messenger from God, who began the doctrine of the Church of Eva the Exultant. The tennants of Eva the Exultant are similar in many regards to extreme interpretations of the teachings of Ludd, however instead of advanced technology being infernal, the Church of Eva believe it is somehow connected to God. The Church considers that using 'divine machinery' is tantamount to heresy, but there are allowances to using high technology if santioned for the sake of removing outsiders from Mercy - sanctions that are being continuously extended in light of the Company's acquisiton of Samiel.",,,

While accessing these stocks directly could be troublesome under the best of times, the combination of neutron radiation, local piracy and strong magnetic fields made viable extraction impossible. However, it was discovered by Hazard Mining that the volatiles could be collected by capturing them when Hurricane is blasted by Kamikaze.
