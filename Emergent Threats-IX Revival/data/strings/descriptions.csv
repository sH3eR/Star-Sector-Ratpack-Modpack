ix_battlegroup,FACTION,"In cycle 70, a large fleet of high-tech warships limped into the Persean Sector, having been placed in emergency cryosleep for decades after the gate network collapse. The arrival of a 9th Domain Battlegroup task force was initially welcomed by the Hegemony, who hoped to settle the newcomers and make use of their advanced technology. However, negotiations suddenly turned violent for reasons that remain classified, resulting in a massive battle over the skies of Jangala. The task force was defeated by the narrowest of margins and withdrew their remaining ships to a system on the edge of the Core Worlds, where they have maintained a state of perpetual war against every other major polity of the Sector ever since.

Often referred to simply as ""the Fleet,"" the IX Battlegroup sees itself as the true inheritor of the Domain of Man. Fleet Command governs the Zorya system under a strict military dictatorship, using both naval and economic force projection to constantly destabilize the rest of the Sector. Before its worlds are reclaimed for the Domain, free captains and mercenaries are tolerated as useful pawns. Everyone else is prey.",,,
ix_trinity,FACTION,"Originally a loose band of former Eridani-Utopia Terraforming Corporation worksites and early stage colonies that attempted, and failed, to resist a hostile takeover from the Persean branch of the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. The Trinity Worlds served as an unwilling client state to the megacorp during the First AI War, which left its home system of Danu devastated by the conflict. Left to fend for themselves once more following the armistice, the colonies had little to no political impact on the rest of the Sector.

That state of affairs drastically changed in cycle 133, when the Trinity Worlds leadership unexpectedly declared for the 9th Domain Battlegroup. The speed of the bloodless takeover and the near total information blackout to descend upon Danu shocked the major powers, whose worst fears were soon confirmed when Trinity Worlds warships began operating alongside the Fleet. The exact nature of this alliance, or conquest, remains unexplained to the Sector at large, but it has become abundantly clear that the Trinity Worlds now function as an extension of the uncompromising will of Fleet Command.",,,

#Trinity Worlds,,,,,
brawler_tw,SHIP,"A heavily modified Brawler that bears many similarities to the standard Tri-Tachyon overhaul, but uses a plasma microburst system instead of the more common plasma jets. The design was an intermediate step in the development of the Candor-class gunship, and Tri-Tachyon never built more than a small handful of prototypes. However, given their limited access to ship blueprints, the Trinity Worlds have pressed this unusual variant into full scale military service.",,,
candor_tw,SHIP,"A technological marvel created by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation at its peak. The Candor was advertised as a hard hitting ""Super Brawler"" gunship intended for discerning clients who sought better performance than the already impressive Brawler (TT) retrofit, but could not quite justify the eye watering logistics profile of the Hyperion. A fully automated drone variant with an enhanced point defense suite was rumored to be in development, but was never released prior to the Collapse.",,,
equalizer_tw,SHIP,"A high-tech battleship prototype that represents an attempt to revive the all-big-guns paradigm of an earlier age. Unlike its ancient predecessors, the Equalizer is equipped with state of the art capacitor banks that grant it remarkable cruising speed and endurance. A smattering of limited arc point defense mounts have been begrudgingly included in the design, but veteran captains will just as often leave them empty, relying on the ship's powerful shields and main weapons to win the day.",,,
firebird_tw,SHIP,"A midline cruiser given an extensive high-tech overhaul. The Firebird (TW) is so far removed from its Eagle and Falcon cruiser origins, it can scarcely be called a derivative of either. The ship was largely designed by Trinity Worlds scientists, and is far more common among its forces that its 9th Battlegroup Auxiliary counterparts. This localized model exhibits improved engine performance at the cost of targeting range, which encourages Trinity Worlds captains to favor speed and aggression over long range engagements.",,,
flamebreaker_tw,SHIP,"A high-tech cruiser prototype equipped with advanced sensors, along with a set of high performance capacitors that can temporarily supercharge its energy weapons. The Flamebreaker excels at long range suppression of enemy forces, but is relatively sluggish compared to other high-tech hulls.",,,
flourish_tw,SHIP,"A nimble and versatile attack frigate featuring a novel secondary shield system wired to an independent plasma core. The Flourish (TW) is one of the few examples of an in-depth technology transfer from the 9th Domain Battlegroup to the Trinity Worlds, and features superior performance when compared to other similar ships found in the Sector.",,,
intrepid_tw,SHIP,"A high-tech battleship prototype intended to replace the venerable Onslaught. The Intrepid was the result of bitter compromises between reformers and traditionalists within the Domain Navy, and bears several antiquated design traits such as fixed forward shields and built-in energy weapons that are rarely found on high-tech hulls. Nonetheless, it is a highly capable flotilla leader when its vulnerable flanks are well protected by escorts.",,,
ionos_tw,SHIP,"A high-tech battlecruiser based on purportedly the largest warship capable of safely transiting through phase space. The blueprint for the Ionos was recovered by the Trinity Worlds in a particularly degraded state, and was stowed away in a data vault for decades before finally being realized with significant assistance from the 9th Domain Battlegroup. The finalized design is much more heavily armed than the prototype, a feat that could only be accomplished by limiting the fire arcs of its heavy energy weapons and downgrading its complex phase skimmer system. Nonetheless, the Ionos (TW) remains capable of bringing heavy firepower to a skirmish with surprising alacrity.",,,
iris_tw,SHIP,"A high-tech destroyer prototype equipped with an experimental Interceptor Burst Laser. The Iris can intercept a large volume of incoming fighters and missiles, freeing capital ships under its protection to focus on engaging enemy forces directly.",,,
maquech_tw,SHIP,"A simple carrier conversion of the Buffalo-class freighter was used as a testbed for Nimbus drone control technology. Although never intended for frontline combat, the Trinity Worlds have pressed the design into military service, as even with many of its ships bearing converted drone bays, the cheap and reliable Maquech still remains the most cost effective way to deploy a large number of Nimbus drones.",,,
nimbus_crewed_tw,SHIP,"This rarely seen crewed variant of the Nimbus combat drone is usually reserved exclusively for orbital defense garrisons, as such facilities cannot afford to compromise their shields by installing a Drone Control Node. The fighter can also be operated aboard modified Trinity Worlds vessels, although there is little benefit from doing so, due to a human pilot's inability to fully integrate with an AI overseer.",,,
nimbus_tw,SHIP,"A heavy automated combat drone that makes up for what it lacks in firepower with incredible durability and staggering EMP output. The Nimbus was invented on Finias during the First AI War, and has survived into the modern day as a partially corrupted blueprint still in use by the Trinity Worlds.",,,
radiant_tw,SHIP,"Many of the systems onboard have been deliberately downgraded to allow the converted droneship to be operated safely by its human crew, and the process to convert the hull into a combat drone mothership has also greatly constrained the flexibility of its weapon mountings. Nonetheless, any opposing ship that lacks excellent shields and point defenses will find itself quickly torn apart by a massive drone swarm backed by capital grade weapons.",,,
shrike_tw,SHIP,"The commonly available Shrike-class light destroyer was used to trial the Contender Autolance, a role in which it was moderately well suited. Not willing to let the significant resources that went into altering the blueprint go to waste, the Trinity Worlds have since put the modified hull into full scale production.",,,
tigershark_tw,SHIP,"A model of the Tigershark high-tech cruiser unique to the Trinity Worlds. Due to defects in the original blueprint, its creators opted to forego the ship's intended role as a universal weapons platform, and instead install an unusual built-in composite weapon in its forward hardpoint.",,,
,,,,,
abolisher_built_in_tw,WEAPON,"The result of a special project by the Trinity Worlds to solve defects in their copy of the Tigershark blueprint. The Integrated Abolisher Cannon is a straightforward Lorentz force weapon of moderate power output. More notable is the special munitions it fires, which is based on a stripped down Orthrus torpedo minus its guidance package and DEM chamber, but packing a larger warhead. The rocket assisted projectile can achieve impressive range in combat, but cannot adjust its course once fired.",,,
abolisher_tw,WEAPON,"The Abolisher Rail Cannon is an unusual composite Lorentz force weapon that launches direct fire torpedos. Once out of the barrel, each round will continue to accelerate for a brief time from its rocket assist motor. The simple plasma warhead can be fabricated on site, although modular design constraints slightly limit yield and range compared to the built-in version.",,,
cte_tw,WEAPON,"A seeker type quantum entanglement weapon created by the Trinity Worlds. The Charge Transfer Emitter fires a slow moving self guided plasma projectile that inflicts respectable damage on its own. However, upon making contact with an enemy ship, the projectile will create a short lived transdimensional channel for a secondary energy pulse to be fired at the same target.",,,
cutting_beam_tw,WEAPON,"An effort by the Trinity Worlds to adapt the Cutting Beam for its own forces, the Contender Autolance is an assault weapon that can effectively slice through exposed ship hulls, while still being somewhat useful against shields and armor.",,,
cutting_beam_tw_er,WEAPON,"An effort by the Trinity Worlds to adapt the Cutting Beam for its own forces, the Contender Autolance is an assault weapon that can effectively slice through exposed ship hulls, while still being somewhat useful against shields and armor. This built-in extended range version has improved beam coherence over longer distances.",,,
interceptor_pd_tw,WEAPON,A prototype Heavy Burst Laser that can maintain a constant rate of fire. The complex assembly and targeting suite limit its use as a built-in weapon on a dedicated point defense escort.,,,
ion_micropulser_tw,WEAPON,"A pair of lightweight ion cannons built into the hull of the Candor. Originally intended to be a full sized EMP emitter, space constraints of the bridge and crew quarters caused the designers to mount this stopgap weapon instead, until a fully automated version of the gunship could be developed.",,,
ion_micropulser_tw_fighter,WEAPON,"A pair of lightweight ion cannons that can be supercharged to fire at a greatly accelerated rate. While the temperamental subsystems of the Candor could never tolerate such rough handling, the rugged Nimbus drone has no such limitations.",,,
pilum_tw_fighter,WEAPON,A stripped down version of the Pilum LRM that discards the bulky first stage booster rocket. This fighter launched support weapon applies moderate EMP pressure while overwhelming point defense grids.,,,
spatial_charge_tw_fighter,WEAPON,Launches unguided projectiles that unleash a high energy positron stream at the nearest target upon reaching arming distance. This compact strike craft variant has a less powerful launcher which partially limiting its range.,,,
spearwall_tw,WEAPON,"An anachronistic composite weapon that fires electrically primed rocket propelled flechettes from a rotating assembly. The increased heat signature of each projectile allows for interception by enemy point defenses, although the sheer volume of fire is still bound to stress the flux grid of any ship engaging in active defense. A built-in fire control system also allows the Spearwall to act in a point defense role, although the archaic design is incompatible with modern targeting cores.",,,
,,,,,
#IX Battlegroup,,,,,
aquilon_ix,SHIP,"Drawing upon lessons learned from the Glycon-class missile cruiser, Eridani-Utopia further developed the Aquilon, a versatile battlecruiser intended for the most demanding of security missions. The integrated launcher of its cruiser forebearer was improved to allow for switching between a variety of munitions without needing to return to dock. The cutting edge design even drew the attention of Domain Navy special forces. However, adoption among the various battlegroups was limited prior to the Collapse, due to concerns of the battlecruiser being under-gunned when compared to existing capital ships.",,,
axiom_ix,SHIP,"Fast and heavily shielded 9th Domain Battlegroup interceptor, equipped with an emergency flux shunt that keeps the craft operational even when its shields are overloaded. Prior to its arrival in the Persean Sector, the mission profile of the Fleet had placed a heavy emphasis on minimizing attrition, and so for much of its history it did not operate with crewed fighters. That has recently begun to change, with the Axiom appearing in large numbers in the defense of its orbital facilities.",,,
banteng_base,SHIP,"A freighter that combines ample cargo space with extended range fuel tanks, alleviating the need for dedicated tanker ships when hauling long distance freight. Rarely seen while Gate travel was still ubiquitous, the Banteng has found renewed popularity post-Collapse as a commercial hauler, exploration vessel, and even militarized fleet tender. Its excellent range and relatively robust weapon mounts make it well suited to operating on the lawless frontier.",,,
buffalo_ix,SHIP,"Despite being ruggedized, the Buffalo (IX) is still a light freighter, and must rely upon escorts to survive coming under fire.",,,
candor_ix,SHIP,"An advanced gunship design reverse engineered from partial blueprints from the Trinity Worlds, combined with samples of battlefield salvage. The Candor (IX) has come closest among the modern day variants in capturing the terrifying performance of the fully automated model previously seen during the First AI War. However, the complex engineering that has gone into achieving this feat has also made it notably harder to maintain. This has not stopped the 9th Domain Battlegroup from deploying the ship in numbers, while production of its other advanced gunships are still ramping up.",,,
casimir_ix_a,SHIP,"The Casimir's most noticeable trait is its pair of medium missile hardpoints, which allow for a frighting payload of heavy ordnance in a compact package. Any captain at the helm would be well advised to account for its relative high speed but poor maneuverability, and ready a course of escape before committing to a skirmish. Such precautions are especially necessary given the ship's lack of advanced IX modifications to its engines or shields.",,,
dictum_ix,SHIP,"A cutting edge heavy fighter of the 9th Domain Battlegroup, bearing the same emergency flux shunt as its interceptor counterpart. The Dictum is almost guaranteed to outmatch any other comparable strike craft in a one-on-one engagement. However, its extremely demanding maintenance requirements limit its deployment in large numbers.",,,
equalizer_ix,SHIP,"A recently unveiled carrier variant of a cutting edge warship rarely seen in the Persean Sector, the Equalizer (IX) is equipped with a causality violating Immanence Engine, capable of briefly propelling the ship into an accelerated yet entropy resistant time frame. To an outside observer, the massive vessel will appear to suddenly maneuver and attack at a frenzied pace, while becoming highly resistant to damage.",,,
firebird_ix,SHIP,"A midline cruiser given an extensive high-tech overhaul. The Firebird (A) is purported to be entirely designed and assembled by foreign collaborators of the 9th Domain Battlegroup, and is intended to demonstrate both their newfound commitment to the Fleet, and their renewed technological expertise under its guidance. However, beneath the sleek exterior is a fairly conventional design that borrows heavily from the ubiquitous Falcon and Eagle cruisers, with any upgrades to engine and reactor performance placing an equally great demand upon logistics. The only other feature of note is an automated flare launcher operated independently by the ship's tactical computer.",,,
flamebreaker_ix,SHIP,"Based on a high-tech cruiser hull that has long been known to the Fleet, but never put into service due to its relatively slow speed, the heavily revised Flamebreaker (IX) has finally found its place as the 9th Domain Battlegroup's latest combat carrier. The advanced sensors of the preceding design have been fine tuned for both point defense and flight command, while a robust fighter autoforge and launch bay have taken the place of heavy missile armaments.",,,
flourish_stock,SHIP,"A nimble attack frigate with the capability to mount both ballistic and energy weapons. Features a secondary shield system wired to an independent plasma core, allowing for both shields to be used simultaneously and for shielding to be maintained while overloaded or actively venting flux.

Sharing many similarities to the older Lasher-class, the Flourish is a late Expansion Epoch update of its aged predecessor, with numerous changes to reflect the strike focused doctrine of its creation. Post-Collapse, the Tri-Tachyon Corporation secured a partial blueprint of the design from the 9th Domain Battlegroup in a daring feat of corporate espionage. While they could not fully replicate its most cutting edge features, Tri-Tachyon did manage to alter the hardpoint mounts to accomidate a more diverse range of weapons for their mass production variant.",,,
flourish_ix,SHIP,"A nimble and versatile attack frigate featuring a novel secondary shield system wired to an independent plasma core. The Flourish (IX) actually predates its more commonplace downgraded variant in the Sector, having arrived with the original 9th Domain Battlegroup taskforce. The secrets of its fully enveloping undershield could not be replicated by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation even after they stole the design blueprints.",,,
glycon_tw,SHIP,"The result of a late Expansion Epoch private venture by the Eridani-Utopia Terraforming Corporation, the Glycon is a high-tech light missile cruiser designed to ""punch down"" with overwhelming force, and annihilate any target smaller than itself in the opening volley. This particular example was built from a partially corrupted blueprint. It lacks a functional missile nanoforge, but is also simpler to maintain and deploy.",,,
hetman_ix_a,SHIP,"The once spacious cargo holds of the Hetman have been almost fully replaced by a cavernous hangar bay, allowing a near unprecedented number of squadrons to be fielded from a destroyer sized hull. However, given its lack of advanced IX upgrades to its engines and shields, its other performance factors are somewhat lacking. The onboard microforge is especially notable for having trouble assembling more complex strike craft.",,,
hyperion_ix_hg,SHIP,"The design was tested as a potential candidate for a highly maneuverable light warship capable of fielding a capital grade energy weapon, but was passed over for the far less logistically demanding Mandrake (IX) class destroyer. With no plans for mass production, the original prototype was decommissioned, and has not been seen again, until now.",,,
iconoclast_ix,SHIP,"Based on the slow and defense oriented Iris-class destroyer, the Iconoclast (IX) has been radically re-envisioned as a specialized interdiction assault ship with the speed to keep up with the rest of the Fleet. It is equipped with both fighter bays and a compact Interdictor Array, making it the bane of any ship that seeks to outmaneuver or flee from an invading flotilla.",,,
intrepid_ix,SHIP,"Envisioned as a radical upgrade of the Intrepid-class battleship, which was itself already the intended high-tech replacement for the venerable Onslaught-class battleships still serving with the Domain Armada, the Intrepid (IX) has been outfitted with several exotic technologies developed by the 9th Domain Battlegroup following their arrival in the Persean Sector. The ship is fast and deadly in a frontal assault, especially when its vulnerable flanks are well protected as part of a large formation.",,,
iris_ix,SHIP,"A production variant of the experimental Iris (EX), this dedicated fleet escort replaces the prototype built-in point defense weapon of the original with a less complex Brightburn CIWS array. While the design would be further refined into the infamous Iconoclast (IX) class of interdiction assault ships, the original would also remain in service with the Fleet due to the abundance of hostile forces that make heavy use of strike craft within the Persean Sector.",,,
mandrake_ix,SHIP,"A nimble destroyer widely used by the 9th Domain Battlegroup as a long range skirmisher. The Mandrake (IX) can be equipped with a capital grade energy weapon. But unlike its counterparts that rely on raw firepower, it is designed for hit and run attacks to frustrate less mobile adversaries.",,,
maxim_ix,SHIP,"An advanced gunship only recently brought out of prototype and into full service with the 9th Domain Battlegroup. The Maxim (IX) is armed with a downsized single-shot Muon Siege Lance, and is operated by the Fleet as a heavy bomber analog. A demanding strike craft in terms of both maintenance and manpower, it has nonetheless quickly proven itself it be a deadly adversary.",,,
odyssey_ix,SHIP,"A heavily modified Odyssey-class battlecruiser, partly based on the technology reverse engineered from a Tri-Tachyon militarized hull captured in the defense of Zorya, but also bearing various alterations unique to the 9th Domain Battlegroup. The biggest change to the hull is its built-in heavy ordnance launcher, which completely replaces the primary hangar bay. The repurposed drone fabricators ensure a steady supply of long range cruise missiles even during protracted engagements.",,,
radiant_ix,SHIP,"Many of the systems onboard have been deliberately downgraded to allow the converted droneship to be operated safely by its human crew. Nonetheless, the IX Battlegroup have successfully modified the hull with their own standard fleetwide enhancements, making the Radiant (IX) one of the most formidable warships of the Sector.",,,
radiant_ix_hvb,SHIP,"However, unlike other reclaimed Radiant (IX) battleships, this particular example retains a fully functional AI core interface that was specifically modified to accommodate a shard of the machine intelligence at the heart of Vertex Station Fleet Command. Should such technology ever be widely adopted by the 9th Domain Battlegroup, it would represent a clear escalation in their efforts to conquer the Sector.",,,
temblor_ix,SHIP,"Due to a long history of conducting remote missions with minimal resupply, the Fleet has traditionally eschewed the use of fragile combat drones. However, adhering strictly to past doctrine is a luxury it can no longer afford. The Temblor (IX) is intended to be the first step in rapidly closing the gap with the numerous hostile polities in the Sector that possess far greater expertise in fighter deployment.",,,
terminus_ix,SHIP,"An experimental combat drone based on the already capable Terminator, the Terminus (IX) has been fine tuned to utilize its Morningstar Close-In Weapon System to the greatest possible effect. It is an extremely capable missile interceptor, upon which the crews of Fleet entrust with their lives.",,,
tigershark_ix,SHIP,"A high-tech cruiser that shares many design elements with the Aurora, each Tigershark (IX) is painstakingly retrofitted after forge production to address the numerous minor yet notable flaws that plague the base template. The end result is a highly specialized hunter-killer, produced in extremely limited numbers for the most elite units of the 9th Domain Battlegroup.",,,
tigershark_ix_hvb,SHIP,"The Tigershark (HG) is a fully automated variant of the high-tech attack cruiser used by the 9th Domain Battlegroup. In addition to being upgraded with enhanced shields, it also has the ability to switch between a small number of adaptive subsystems. The AI core interface appears to be an early stage prototype, suggesting the ship remains far from entering full scale production. However, the very fact that such experiments in automation are being conducted by its creators brings the Sector closer to another major AI War.",,,
,,,,,
ix_capacitors,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Activate backup capacitors to bolster energy weapon range, while reducing their flux load for a short time.",Offensive,,
ix_drone_pd,SHIP_SYSTEM,Deploys a large number of laser-armed defensive drones. The drones can be ordered to closely guard the ship or roam freely around it.,Defensive,,

,,,,,
antecedent_ix,WEAPON,"This ponderous but incredibly well armored heavy cruise missile carries a powerful wide dispersal warhead. When detonated, it alters the vacuum energy of the surrounding area to a far higher baseline, resembling the conditions of an earlier cosmological epoch. The effect is transitory but devastating. Only the firing ship can avoid the worst of the anomaly. All others nearby shall find themselves engulfed by the burning firmament.",,,
bereaver_dem_launcher_ix,WEAPON,"A devastating standoff DEM that fires a long duration plasma beam from outside the range of most point defense systems. Each Bereaver missile is essentially a miniaturized one shot Daythorn emitter paired with its own advanced optics focal lens. The high precision nano-assembler inside the launcher is difficult to manufacture even for the IX Battlegroup, and has limited the weapon's adoption to the elite Honor Guard.

The capital grade triple DEM launcher is an enlarged version of the standard pod design that improves both ammo capacity and firepower.",,,
bereaver_dem_pod_ix,WEAPON,"A devastating standoff DEM that fires a long duration plasma beam from outside the range of most point defense systems. Each Bereaver missile is essentially a miniaturized one shot Daythorn emitter paired with its own advanced optics focal lens. The high precision nano-assembler inside the launcher is difficult to manufacture even for the IX Battlegroup, and has limited the weapon's adoption to the elite Honor Guard.",,,
brightburn_ciws_ix,WEAPON,"A heavy point defense IR Pulse Laser array that also functions as a shield suppressing assault cannon. The Brightburn boasts a truly impressive rate of fire, while also being easy to maintain and operate. The wide set triple emitter design necessary to accommodate its vast banks of heat sinks slightly lowers the odds of a successful intercept, but many captains of the Fleet still favor it simply for the rapid fire intimidation factor.",,,
conversion_lance_ix,WEAPON,"The dreaded Conversion Lance generates short lived magnetic monopoles at the point of impact, explosively converting the entire trailing particle stream's mass into energy. The effect is nothing short of ruinous against exposed armor. Fortunately for the rest of the Sector, not even the IX Battlegroup can mass produce these complex weapons.",,,
cutting_beam_ix,WEAPON,A refinement upon the IR Autolance that meets the stringent requirements demanded by the 9th Domain Battlegroup. Its impressive performance could only be achieved by directly incorporating the beam emitter into the hull of an upgraded Intrepid-class battleship.,,,
dawnstar_hcpb_ix,WEAPON,"An unusual beam weapon that can disrupt shields in a manner more typical of high speed projectiles, the Dawnstar Cyclic Particle Beam uses a novel multi-chamber design to generate rapid bursts of fire that blur into a continuous stream. The weapon can be configured to emit a variety of high energy particles, allowing it to meet any challenge on the battlefield.

Notable for having been created by the Fleet after arriving in the Persean Sector, the few examples of captured Dawnstars have yielded little insight into their operating principles. Their innards can charitably be described as a techno-barbarian's fever dream, and yet the weapon performs exceedingly well under combat conditions, and with minimal maintenance. No human alone could have possibly designed such a convoluted yet effective weapon, a fact which does not bode well for the many enemies of the 9th Domain Battlegroup.",,,

daythorn_mapb_ix,WEAPON,"The Daythorn Mono Adaptive Particle Beam fires a moderately powerful focused plasma stream in its default configuration. However, when paired with the Dawnstar Cyclic Particle Beam, it gains many of the same benefits from the Dawnstar's more powerful particle generator.

A simplified miniaturization of the Dawnstar CPB, the Daythorn could never fully match the range and raw power output of the original, nor replicate its fabled versatility. However, the weapon imparts a notably lower flux load on the firing ship, making it suited to many lighter vessels used by the Fleet.",,,

diffraction_laser_ix,WEAPON,"A dynamically modulated shield penetrating laser. This effect is usually little more than a curiosity, since the low powered beam is barely able to scratch the paint on hull plating. However, the coherent laser backscattering can be used to infer weak points in any intervening shield barrier, allowing other more capable weapons to impose greater flux against the illuminated target.",,,
es_projector_ix,WEAPON,"An exotic ""dust gun"" that accelerates micrometer pellets of fissile material in a continuous high velocity particle cloud. Impact results in a deadly combination of kinetic force and micro-fission ignition, rapidly degrading even the most powerful shield emitters, while still remaining moderately useful against reinforced armor.",,,
ifc_ix,WEAPON,"Combining the deadly munitions of the Electrostatic Projector with the magnetic confinement technology of the Plasma Cannon, the Impact Fusion Cannon trades raw power output for greater range at a lower flux load. The enhanced projectile velocity causes it to undergo spontaneous fusion on impact, unleashing a violent burst of both kinetic and thermal energy.",,,
interdictor_iris_ix,WEAPON,"A scaled down variant of the Interdictor Array, mounted in a fixed forward position in place of a Fortress Shield. This device has a shorter range and is far more taxing on the reactor when fired compared to the battleship scale version, but remains just as effective at disrupting shields and ensnaring fleeing ships. Captains trained by the 9th Domain Battlegroup can achieve a faster rate of fire without the need for special modifications.",,,
lightbringer_ciws_ix,WEAPON,"An upscaled Morningstar CIWS in twin barrel configuration, achieving an even greater volume of fire. An effective point defense weapon that can also pressure shields at close range, it is hopelessly outmatched by heavy armor.",,,
lightbringer_fighter_ix,WEAPON,"A simplified fighter variant of the Lightbringer CIWS, intended for close range assault rather than point defense. Effective against shields and lightly defended targets, but performs very poorly again heavy armor.",,,
micrograser_fighter_ix,WEAPON,"The Micrograser takes one of the most capable and deadly capital grade energy weapons ever devised by the Domain, and drastically reduces its size while preserving much of its firepower. The redesign is incompatible with standard weapon mounts, but is well suited for a heavy fighter specifically built around the emitter.",,,
morningstar_ciws_ix,WEAPON,"A modified burst fire IR Pulse Laser with far greater rate of fire and integrated point defense tracking. It is more effective in ship-to-ship combat compared to most point defense weapons, but is relatively power hungry, and performs extremely poorly against heavy armor.",,,
morningstar_fighter_ix,WEAPON,"A prototype continuous fire Morningstar CIWS. Despite the relatively modest upgrades, persistent overheating issues have so far limited its adoption to the Terminus (IX) combat drone.",,,
muon_autolance_ix,WEAPON,"An advanced particle weapon of the late Expansion Epoch, widely used by the 9th Domain Battlegroup. This heavy muon beam emitter achieves even greater energy output and EMP discharge compared to the streamer variant, but its internal capacitors can only sustain firing for several seconds before needing to recharge.",,,
muon_siege_fighter_ix,WEAPON,"A downscale fighter variant of the Muon Siege Lance, capable of only a single shot before needing to connect to a carrier's main reactor to recharge. This weapon has nonetheless put an end to many a brave captain who dared to underestimate the lone gunship rapidly closing on approach.",,,
muon_siege_lance_ix,WEAPON,"The heaviest muon beam emitter in the 9th Domain Battlegroup arsenal. This advanced particle weapon has a total power output roughly comparable to the lighter Muon Autolance. However, it unleashes far more energy during each of its brief firing cycles, which greatly enhances effectiveness against reinforced armor. Many veteran Fleet officers prefer it to all other large energy weapons due to its combination of high damage, armor penetration, and EMP suppression.",,,
muon_streamer_ix,WEAPON,"An advanced particle weapon of the late Expansion Epoch, widely used by the 9th Domain Battlegroup. Fires bursts of short lived muons which instantly decay into high energy electrons upon impact. While the EMP discharge is less intense than specialized ion weapons and cannot pierce shields, the overall energy output significantly outpaces most other beam emitters of its weight class.",,,
orthrus_s_ix,WEAPON,"A hybrid DEM torpedo that packs a powerful one-two punch, the Orthrus engages an enemy in two stages, first unleashing a high intensity plasma beam, before detonating the rest of its payload upon impact. While a versatile weapon, its limited tracking ability is not suited for engaging fast moving targets.

The few records that exist for this weapon suggest it was developed shortly prior to the Collapse, and utilizes plasma containment technology derived from the Domain's stellar engineering projects. Several field trial prototypes were present among the 9th Domain Battlegroup task force stranded within the Persean Sector. It is a testament to their technological prowess that the weapons were not only reverse engineered, but also put into mass production.",,,
orthrus_m_ix,WEAPON,"A hybrid DEM torpedo that packs a powerful one-two punch, the Orthrus engages an enemy in two stages, first unleashing a high intensity plasma beam, before detonating the rest of its payload upon impact. While a versatile weapon, its limited tracking ability is not suited for engaging fast moving targets.

The few records that exist for this weapon suggest it was developed shortly prior to the Collapse, and utilizes plasma containment technology derived from the Domain's stellar engineering projects. Several field trial prototypes were present among the 9th Domain Battlegroup task force stranded within the Persean Sector. It is a testament to their technological prowess that the weapons were not only reverse engineered, but also put into mass production.

This heavy salvo launcher can fire two torpedoes at once, and is also equipped with a more advanced autoloader.",,,
plasma_dart_ix,WEAPON,"Based on a drastically scaled down Thundermark Ion Seeker, the Plasma Dart retains a limited target tracking ability, and is often used in a support role for saturating point defenses and stressing flux grids. The low power output makes it unsuited as a primary assault weapon.",,,
photon_hammer_ix,WEAPON,"An emitter of exotic high momentum paraphotons that flagrantly violate Planck's Constant. Highly debilitating against shields, while causing enough coherent backscattering for any ship in the battlespace to more easily scan the barrier for weak points. 

The Photon Hammer traces its origins to a scientific instrument for studying quantum gravity, but was weaponized by the IX Battlegroup after they salvaged the design from an abandoned Domain high energy research lab. Having repeatedly proven itself in combat, the weapon has become a common sight among the capital ships of the Fleet.",,,
sbe_ix,WEAPON,"The Soliton Burst Emitter was developed from examples of the Hellfire SDEM secured by the 9th Domain Battlegroup. Unlike its crude predecessor, this weapon is powered directly by the main reactor of a specially modified battleship, and exploits complex n-brane physics to generate a topological defect in space-time at the point of impact. Anything caught by the anomaly is quickly torn apart by unimaginable tidal forces.",,,
spatial_charge_launcher_ix,WEAPON,"Launches unguided projectiles that unleash a high energy positron stream at the nearest target upon reaching arming distance. The stream is naturally attracted to a ship's drive field, and imparts both thermal and EM radiation upon impact. An integrated autoloader ensures the weapon will remain useful during protracted engagements.

An obscure weapon for engaging older generation stealth ships, before advances in phase technology rendered it obsolete. Aside from the 9th Domain Battlegroup, blueprints for the Spatial Charge Launcher disappeared in the Persean Sector sometime during the First and Second AI Wars. As the Fleet has continued to build upon the technology into more capable systems such as the Terminus Relay and Vampyr DEM, the original design has also been continually upgraded into a versatile support weapon.",,,
starfall_mlrs_ix,WEAPON,"Derived from the Locust missile system, the Starfall MLRS is an unguided weapon that fires swarms of electrogravitic resonator rockets designed to both swiftly collapse shields and disable exposed systems. Each projectile is charged by the main reactor immediately prior to launch, which imparts a notable flux load on the firing ship.",,,
starfall_fighter_ix,WEAPON,"A secondary weapon for the Axiom (IX), these rockets allow the interceptor to pressure the shields of larger enemy ships, and suppress vulnerable systems once the shields are down.",,,
starfall_rocket_ix,WEAPON,"A downscaled Starfall MLRS that fires swarms of unguided electrogravitic resonator rockets, effective at both overwhelming shields and disabling exposed systems. Unlike most missile weapons, the need to charge each warhead before launch imparts a notable flux load on the firing ship.",,,
stormlight_graser_ix,WEAPON,"A gamma ray burst laser that achieves staggering power output by utilizing positronium Bose-Einstein condensate as its gain medium. Has poor beam cohesion for a capital ship laser, but is very flux efficient due to most of the power being generated by the laser medium itself. Suspending antimatter in liquid helium is a lost art post-Collapse, making this laser a modern day relic.

The experimental Gamma Ray Antimatter Impelled Laser or GRAIL system was undergoing field trials with the 9th Domain Battlegroup at the time of the Collapse. It had been on the verge of cancellation due to its unusually high power output and complexity, both of which was seen as excessive by Domain bureaucrats, and may very well have been abandoned entirely had the gate network remained intact.

As it stands, after decades of trial and error, the best technicians of the Fleet have finally reverse engineered the prototypes into a forge compatible template. The first assembled batch has already found its way to the Honor Guard, who have renamed it the Stormlight for the awe inspiring devastation it can unleash.",,,
twin_tactical_laser_ix,WEAPON,"(This version of the weapon is being depreciated in IX Revival, the replacement version can be found in Tri-Tachyon and Persean League markets if ET is enabled)",,,
thundermark_ix,WEAPON,"A heavily modified Deadeye Plasma Seeker used exclusively by the 9th Domain Battlegroup. The Thundermark fires packets of highly charged ionized plasma, guided by the same esoteric quantum entanglement effect that allows projectiles from the Deadeye to home in on their targets. While lacking the striking power to breach heavy armor, it is nonetheless extremely capable at disabling vulnerable ship systems.",,,
vampyr_ix,WEAPON,"Based on the technology of the Terminus Relay, the Vampyr generates a high energy gamma ray burst against a tungsten emission source, then channels the resulting positron stream at the intended target. The stream is naturally attracted to a ship's drive field, and imparts tremendous heat and EM radiation upon impact. This complex weapon cannot be accommodated even by a large modular mount. It must be integrated into the hull of a suitable warship directly at the forge level.",,,
,,,,,
ix_zorya_sun,CUSTOM,"Zorya has been subjected to stellar engineering efforts by the 9th Domain Battlegroup for the better part of a century. A device resembling a scaled down Hypershunt embedded inside the inner system star fortress continues to alter the stellar corona, causing a massive jet of plasma to be projected from the surface. While the precise purpose of such efforts are unclear, the complete lack of stable jump-points within the inner system is quite likely to be a result.",,,
ix_zorya_piorun,CUSTOM,"Piorun was settled by 9th Domain Battlegroup survivors shortly after their dramatic falling out with the Hegemony. Initially a dry and barely habitable desert world, the surface was bombarded with ice meteorites and seeded with engineered microbes, which combined to rapidly bring the atmosphere towards breathable terran norms. The settlers wasted no time in building their new stronghold into an industrial powerhouse, and have made widespread use of flash imprinted clones who are born loyal to the Fleet.",,"Gleaming towers soar into the sky, bathed in the light of the system's crimson sun. A massive spaceport on the outskirts of the capital directs a steady flow of inner system traffic moving a wealth of refined metals and industrial chemicals off-world, ready to be turned into weapons of war.",
ix_zorya_vertex,CUSTOM,"Seat of the reestablished 9th Domain Battlegroup Fleet Command, and one of the largest space stations ever built, Vertex Station was placed to deliberately maximize thermal exposure to the Zorya star at all times. An exotic quantum computer that violates the laws of thermodynamics sits at the station's heart, performing a staggering amount of strategic calculations that plot the future total victory of Fleet Command.",,"As the gargantuan station looms across your viewscreen, ship sensors begin to pick up a flurry of activity. Automated worker drones dart between hundreds of cargo gantries and docking bays, ferrying supplies and performing maintenance. The Fleet will not rest until every other major polity has been subjugated or destroyed, and so the work continues.",
ix_zorya_rusalka,CUSTOM,"The stormy water world of Rusalka forms a key pillar of the 9th Domain Battlegroup's long term plans to destabilize the Sector. Originally chosen as a site for industrial aquaculture, the unique properties of its ocean biome quickly pivoted the colony towards narcotics production. Massive harvester rigs dredge up entire forests of macroalgae to process into highly addictive psychotropics, which are then sold in bulk to Fleet contacts in the criminal underworld. Those smugglers often go on to make vast fortunes for themselves, while ruining countless lives across the Sector, one euphoric high at a time.",,"The skies of Rusalka are filled with both orderly combat air patrols from the Fleet, and a far more motley group of cargo haulers and pinnaces, often bearing all manner questionable markings. Those who crew the latter know to be on their best behavior at all times. Rusalka's status as a pirate friendly free port has earned it a degree of openness not found anywhere else among the notoriously isolationist IX Battlegroup. However, any misstep from an outsider is likely to draw a quick and decisive response, one that can often end in violence.",
ix_zorya_scorn,CUSTOM,"The planet now known as Scorn serves as an abject reminder of the price of defying the 9th Domain Battlegroup. When the local colonists dared to suggest a negotiated rather than unconditional surrender, the Fleet deliberately bombed its cities with cobalt salted atomics, rendering the surface an irradiated wasteland. Desperate bands of survivors continue to eke out a living in underground shelters and other remote areas, aided by the few free captains who are willing to venture to the surface to trade food and supplies for treasures looted from a dying world.",,"Radiation sensors aboard your ship loudly protest your approach towards the surface. Many of the ruins below were not hit in the initial bombardment of the planet, but were still rendered uninhabitable soon after by radioactive fallout. A local warlord controls what remains of the planet's sole operational starport, acting as the intermediary between survivors in dire need of food and supplies, and free captains keen to exploit their desperation.",
ix_zorya_marzanna,CUSTOM,"A minor polity conquered by the 9th Domain Battlegroup, Marzanna is governed by a collaborationist junta under the merest pretense of local self-rule. The surface is unpleasantly cold and marred by the toxic detritus of heavy industry, but many independent traders still prefer it to nearby Rusalka, given its unique status as the only world in Zorya not kept under the omnipresent surveillance of Fleet Command. This has predictably turned Marzanna into a hotbed of foreign espionage. The spies all know this state of affairs must be intentional, but they still show up all the same.",,"The scars on Marzanna that once marked its conquest by the 9th Domain Battlegroup have been swept away, replaced by gleaming arcologies that shelter its citizens from the uncomfortably cold climate. But beneath the orderly habitats of the model client state lies a darker truth. The planet is dying, slowly but surely, from a corruption both physical and cultural. Pollution from industrial farms and poorly tuned forge-vats choke the air and saturate the ground water. Meanwhile, a ruthless drug cartel rules this world at the behest of distant masters, and drives ever more of their own people to willing throw themselves into the Fleet's insatiable war machine, if only to escape the tyrants they know.",
ix_zorya_overseer,CUSTOM,"A station built by the 9th Domain Battlegroup to rule over conquered Marzanna. In the current day, the invaders have largely handed over the reigns of governance back to their local collaborators, and allow the planet to operate as a special administrative zone with laxer than typical domestic surveillance. Pirates and free traders go to Rusalka to make their fortunes, then come here to spend it all indulging in every vice imaginable.",,"This once staid military installation has been transformed into a glitzy hub of entertainment and commerce. The docks are filled with independent freighters and mercenary gunships, each one more modified and upgunned than the next. A delegation of sleek high-tech vessels in the black, white, and green livery of the Fleet are docket at their own reserved berths, while a squadron of local auxiliaries patrol the space lanes, making their best attempt at professionalism while representatives of the Fleet are so nearby.",

""WARNING: This star system is under the protection of the Domain Armada, 9th Battlegroup. Unauthorized entry will be met with deadly force.""",,,
ix_scarab_wreck,CUSTOM,"The hull of this abandoned frigate appears to be surrounded by a low powered temporal distortion field, and it is a miracle that your sensors detected the ship at all. When adjusted for interference, you begin to pick up strange phantom signals of weapons fire, as well as a series of screaming invectives broadcast on wideband, seemingly directed at someone named Jeff.",,,
ix_antimatter_stabilizer,RESOURCE,"A piece of pre-Collapse technology once commonly found inside the central reactor of frontier outposts. With a creative bit of engineering, this device can be incorporated into a fuel production facility to improve antimatter production at scale.

Stabilizers can be installed on colonies you govern by speaking to the portmaster, or traded to the portmasters of other factions for credits and reputation.",,,
ix_panopticon_core,RESOURCE,"This heavily modified beta core contains a limited scope instance of the IX Battlegroup Fleet Command AI. In combat, it can operate independently at a level that matches or even exceeds a veteran officer, or assist a human commander in an advisory role. At the Vertex Station Honor Guard Armory, the Fleet periodically makes these cores available to its most trusted officers. Anyone else will have a far harder time gaining access to the technology, as they are limited to salvaging from the rare IX Battlegroup ships that carry such a device.

This AI core can be installed onto any non-automated ship in a variety of roles by using the drop-down menu on top of the fitting screen.",,,
ix_broken_core,RESOURCE,"The remains of a partially salvaged AI core. It is irreparably damaged, but the recovered components may be of interest to either researchers or those who seek to limit the proliferation of restricted technology. ",,,
ix_command_core,RESOURCE,(Hidden) Dummy object,,,
ix_panopticon_instance,RESOURCE,This AI core contains a nearly complete instance of the Vertex Station Panopticon. Installing it at a Fleet Embassy or Surveillance Center will grant Panoptic Monitoring to all in-faction colonies within the system.,,,
,,,,,
tw_danu_gorias,CUSTOM,"Gorias once housed one of the largest strategic command hubs of the Core Worlds, and coordinated vast fleets of automated droneships for the Tri-Tachyon corporation. Although the facilities were destroyed long ago, the Trinity Worlds still maintain a colony here to pick through what remains of the ruins on the surface. The Cryoarithmetic Engine now residing at Vertex Station was salvaged from here, and the merest hope of repeating such a find has seen a steady stream of eager tech-miners arrive every cycle.",,"Your shuttle descends below sulfur clouds on its approach to the spaceport. The air itself is corrosive here, yet the ancient military facilities left behind by Tri-Tachyon were built to last. Even now, feral automated war machines prowl the surface, searching for enemies long dead, while giving no quarter to the living. Their continued existence over many cycles has given rise to rumors of an underground mother lode, a still functional pristine nanoforge mindlessly stockpiling weapons of unimaginable power. The greedy hunt for it every day, while the clever sell them the tools to do so.",
tw_danu_murias,CUSTOM,"A cold desert world once slated for colonization. The Collapse and the chaos that followed saw terraforming efforts centuries in the making abandoned over mere months. The atmospheric processors that dot the surface fell silent one by one, unable to stem the tide of entropy, until all had returned to dust.",,"Crumbling towers jutting from the dunes litter the surface. The ruins here were picked clean long ago, and have little left to offer. Here and there, a blip of EM radiation appears on your shuttle's sensors, the signs of a small desert settlement. The descendants of the advanced team of colonists who were left stranded on the surface by the Collapse continue to eke out a living here, occasionally gazing up at one particular star above, while whispering of an opulent palace in the heavens.",
tw_danu_murias_station,CUSTOM,"This unusual station was constructed by the Eridani-Utopia Terraforming Corporation as a pilot project for housing a ""seed community"" near a perspective colony site that could be emigrated en masse, once surface conditions were fit for human habitation. The Collapse has delayed landfall for the residents indefinitely, forcing them to adapt not only to survive, but to provide for what still passes for civilization in the rest of the Danu system.",,"A vast biome set among the stars drifts into view. Emerald Station is one of the largest repositories of biodiversity in the Sector, and houses countless far flung genetic treasures collected while the Gate network was still operational. Even during the height of the AI Wars, neither the Hegemony nor the Church ever fired a shot against it, so deep was their reverence for what lay within.

Nonetheless, the station is clearly showing its age. There is simply too much life onboard for it to easily maintain itself. With air and water recycling systems constantly pushed to the limit, every day is yet another crisis waiting to happen. Many locals are eager to leave, while outsiders who have business here do not tend to stay for long.",
tw_danu_finias,CUSTOM,"A brown dwarf star of unusually low mass that is nonetheless undergoing self sustaining deuterium fusion. Records dating to the late Expansion Epoch classified Finias as a typical gas giant, and following the Tri-Tachyon takeover of the Danu system, it was the site of a major autonomous drone shipyard. What exactly happened to the planet for it to end up in its current state is a hotly contested subject, although one thing is clear, the AI drones that once numbered beyond counting above its skies are long gone.",,"Your sensors detect strangely cyclical energy patterns emitted from the surface of the star. Although resembling standard stellar phenomenon in isolation, when taken in aggregate, their regularity defies easy explanation. Finias has long been the subject of wild speculation from AI watchers, who claim it is everything from being haunted by digital ghosts to being an ascended godlike Jupiter brain that would destroy or uplift all of humanity any day now. The truth, however, remains elusive.",
tw_danu_falais,CUSTOM,"The once placid world of Falais has undergone drastic changes over the last century. Unexpectedly warmed by the transformation of nearby Finias, the surface has become a dramatic display of evaporating ice plumes and rolling thunderstorms. However, despite the harsh conditions groundside, Falais has been aggressively colonized by the residents of Emerald Station. Many are eager to live and work at a place where overcrowding is not an issue.",,"Falais is in the middle of a frenzied resource rush, and new hab domes are constantly being built across the surface. Cargo haulers move to and fro between dig sites and nearby resource processing centers, carrying deuterium and precious ores that have been extracted from the planet's thawing glacial crust. This burst of industrial activity has begun to worry neighboring polities, given the role of the Trinity Worlds in fueling the war efforts of the 9th Domain Battlegroup.",
tw_danu_bodach,CUSTOM,"A dwarf planet in the Brigit's Tears asteroid belt that was briefly mined for minerals during the restoration of Bodach Freehold, before once again been abandoned. Daring pirate crews will occasionally use its nascent gravity well to open an unstable jump-point in order to cut down on transit times to the nearby freeport, much to the displeasure of local traffic control.",,,
tw_danu_bodach_freehold,CUSTOM,"Officially, Bodach Freehold is an old Eridani-Utopia supply depot that has been restored and expanded into a proper space station, and is run by a retired tech-miner who struck it rich selling an intact Cryoarithmetic Engine to the 9th Domain Battlegroup. Unofficially, it is a major staging area for freebooters in the employ of the Fleet to harass the shipping lanes of the Core Worlds. The local arms bazaar does a brisk trade in both advanced energy weapons and strategic quantities of starship fuel, a rarity among the other so called ""pirate"" colonies.",,"Bodach Freehold is the site of a rare independently owned antimatter fuel production facility that was spun up with significant investments from nearby Falais. Why that world did not simply take over the station and place it under military rule is a hotly debated topic among foreign analysts. However, the influence of Falais aboard Bodach Freehold is hard to overstate. Nothing is bought or sold here without the Trinity Worlds, and by extension the Fleet, knowing about it. This has caused more than one paranoid mercenary to turn down an opportunity to refit their ship, for fear that the exotic energy weapons sold here are full of hidden viruses and back doors.",
tw_danu_fort_culmen,CUSTOM,"Fort Culmen began its existence as a small 9th Domain Battlegroup forward operations base during the Danu takeover, although it has steadily grown in size and firepower since then as the Trinity Worlds became more integral to the military ambitions of Fleet Command. A sizable permanent garrison is stationed here to keep watch over the system's outer jump-point, freeing up the local defenders to concentrate on guarding the inner system.",,"Although notably smaller than Vertex Station, seat of the 9th Domain Battlegroup Fleet Command, the heavy armaments mounted on Fort Culmen are no less imposing. The station itself is anchored to the fringe jump-point of the Danu system, close enough to keep watch over it, but far enough to not leave itself vulnerable to ambush.

In this position, the station also serves as a major transit hub between Danu and Zorya. It offers merchants who would rather steer clear of the inner system pirates a chance to make a consistent if not stellar profit on various commercial trade goods. The station director is rumored to be out of favor with Fleet Command, being promoted sideways into a position far from any chance at glory.",
