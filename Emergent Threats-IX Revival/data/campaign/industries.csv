The Kresnik Mechanism serves as the system's first and most dangerous line of defense. By manipulating the hyperwave field of the nearby star, this fearsome engine can momentarily collapse an in-system jump point and atomize all surrounding baryonic matter. However, the extremely long firing sequence limits its use to deterring large scale blockades.

Emits a large blast wave from a blockaded jump point 10 days after the arrival of the hostile force, and again every 10 days thereafter, until the blockade is destroyed.",3000,

The cartel is never short of recruits, as becoming an enforcer is one of the few ways for a poor citizen of Marzanna to escape a life of crushing toil on the surface.

While it is weaker than its predecessor and far too cumbersome to use in ship-to-ship combat, a single shot aimed at the nearby jump-point is still enough to temporarily destabilize it, with the resulting blast wave vaporizing any hostile fleet foolish enough to remain in blockade formation.
