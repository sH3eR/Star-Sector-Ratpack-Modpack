		#BOUNTY DESCRIPTION
		"job_name": "A Theory of Mind",
		"job_description": "Hegemony COMSEC is abuzz with the latest discovery of a \"ghost signal\" broadcast from a distant region of the Sector. \nDuring the First AI War, Hegemony forces had used such signal intercepts to track Tri-Tachyon's roaming AI drone fleets. However, the vulnerability was discovered and patched out long before the war ended. That another signal was detected now likely means Tri-Tachyon leaked it intentionally to their historic rivals. \nSuspecting a trap, COMSEC has taken the unusual step of hiring independent contractors to intercept and destroy this new drone fleet in the ==$system system==. COMSEC will gather useful intelligence whether the contractors succeed or fail, but at least the pay is decent.",
		
		"job_comm_reply": "Upon intercepting the mysterious ships, it is immediately obvious to you that this is no typical remnant fleet. Within its ranks are vessels painted in the colors of the 9th Domain Battlegroup, although they too appear to be fully automated. Whatever they're doing out here, they seem to have no interest in talking to you, and have made their intentions clear by charging weapons and raising shields.",
		
		"job_intel_success": "Pouring over records salvaged from the wreckage, you discover the two fleets were engaged in some manner of technology exchange. Much of the data is encrypted beyond your ability to decipher, but among them is a notable relic of the Domain-era, a ==Cerebral Biochip==. While the implant was clearly intended for humans, it appears to have been delivered by the remnant to the 9th Domain Battlegroup forces. Even more curiously, both fleets seem to have engaged in extensive efforts to hide their meeting from their own respective forces. What exactly they were up to is a mystery for COMSEC analysts to figure out. You have your credits, and your salvage.",
