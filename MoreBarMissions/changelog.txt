- changed version string to 0.97a-RC6

  "java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: lunalib/lunaSettings/LunaSettingsListener" issue

Version 0.0.1 (2023-05-28):
- modified the event frequency such that events picked at less than their expected frequency gets a probability boost compared to pure random;
  this also tends to cycle through the events more than pure random

- initial release
- tried my best to make an utility mod that you can safely remove, but don't blame me if I fucked it up
