Capable of taking on entire strike fleets and coming out with only minor damage, it boasts a huge arsenal of weaponry, four flight decks, powerful shield generators and targeting supercomputers that allow it to wipe out destroyers and frigates before they can even get a single shot off. Each individual module is fully customisable, with modular weapon slots and facilities for the repair and re-arming of any kind of fighter the Sector has to offer.

This particular model of battlestation was once used by the Domain to protect high-value targets, from gates to the hyperspace entrances to populated systems. Just one Asgard can dissuade a strike or invasion - otherwise, the attacker risks being blown into little pieces by a neverending hail of ordnance.

The best way to defeat an Asgard-class is to focus fire on its modules, as taking them out lessens its overwhelming firepower and can cause damage to adjacent modules. In particular, the larger modules contain the shield generators and flight decks - but they're also the toughest. EMP weaponry and high-yield, durable torpedoes are recommended.",,,

planet_jangala_independent,CUSTOM,"The cursed emerald of the Corvus system retains a deadly, bountiful biosphere alongside a robust population suited for survival in such terrain. Its vast fields tended by remote harvesters, its seas combed for valuable products, Jangala remains one of the most productive bodies of organics, food, and xenobiological material. Possessing a majority Luddite population, separation from the Hegemony has not shaken the strong militaristic streak in its native citizens.",,"The airtight cities of the poisonous world are remarkably safe, patrolled by a disciplined planetary defense force, composed primarily of former Hegemony personnel. Those who were deemed unfit for service have coalesced into the Knights of the Rose, a paramilitary gang that some citizens rumor are controlled by the former Field Marshal, now Defense Secretary of the planet. Attacks by the Roses are readily denounced by the Defense Secretary, and members of his party are quick to pledge support to aid recovery from such incidents. It is so far considered coincidental that such attacks occur only to those advocating a less than friendly stance with the Hegemony.",
planet_jangala_luddic_church,CUSTOM,"The jewel of the Corvus system is considered holy to most Luddites, its contiguous jungle no less magnificent for its deadly nature. Storms regularly sway the wild forests, fauna is usually violent, and flora populates the biosphere with airborne poison. The great bounty produced by the world's fields and seas is safeguarded by the Eternal Guard, former planetary guardsmen of the Hegemony, now protectors of all from soaring cities to humble village domes.",,"While the robotic harvesters have been kept running, and Jangala Station continues burn maintenance to keep the grasping jungle from the fields and sealed cities, most heavy industry has been disabled. The orbital burning is deemed a necessary evil by the faithful, who conduct prayer for forgiveness whenever operating the station's powerful weapon. The Sub-Presbyter Orbis is often advised by the leader of the Eternal Guard, former Field Marshal of the planetary forces, in the defense of new and existing settlements from bandits and beasts of the green. The Knights of Ludd and Eternal Guard often cooperate in patrols and exercises, but Knights are not permitted into the deep jungle bunkers of the Guard for reasons unknown. As a result, a measure of distrust exists between the two orders, despite efforts of the Sub-Presbyter Orbis.",
planet_jangala_luddic_path,CUSTOM,"The holy hand of God's fury has been claimed by Ludd's Chosen, the Emerald of Corvus now untainted by the heretical finger of Jangala Station's orbital laser. Farms and seas remain untouched, native xenolife unchecked except in the few holy pilgrimage sites tended to by the Emerald Guardians, serving as both temples for the faithful of Ludd, and embankment points for Ludd's most holy crusades into the crushing foliage of His most terrible wrath. His will made manifest, the jungle has destroyed all heretical industry of man that dared to defy it in years past. The only remnant of such hubris is the holy crucible of Jangala, through which Pathers must prove themselves worthy of remembrance as saints; the Jangala Hellfighters.",,"As there is no known location of the Hellfighters, Pather crusades will brazenly march the banner of Ludd deep into the jungle, establish defenses, and await the crucible with trembling hand. Those who survive these crusades are shaken, describing figures of burning infernium crashing through the perimeter of their camps. Those who return, dead or alive, share a single trait; the symbol of the Path, burned into their breast with hot iron. The High Crusader has declared the death of the Field Marshal to be of utmost importance, for he defies the will of Ludd. Even in the temples, there are whispers the field marshal cannot be killed, a demon who defies the rules of death. Jangala, the most holy of proving grounds, is a land of devils.",
planet_jangala_persean,CUSTOM,"League officials have declared with the taking of Jangala, the hated Hegemony has been weakened, its forces in full retreat from the planet as they recognize this is the death knell of their empire. This is the official statement. On the surface however, a contradicting message is relayed to planetary defense forces. On this beautiful poisonous planet, there is a threat beyond the violent megastorms, hostile fauna, and toxic flora. Returning League soldiers describe the threat as hollow-eyed terrorists, seemingly wearing no biofilters. Such talk is dissident propaganda, along with the unofficial name ascribed to these agitators, the Toxic Avengers.",,"Each day there is the threat of terrorism, public events and buildings struck by unknown assailants, often crying out a scream of support for the Field Marshal, who is officially dead. The League regularly sends conscripts into the hungry roots of the jungle to confirm his death, and to ensure the supposed Avengers are no longer a threat. While a large number of League assets have been sent into the jungles of Jangala, many remain deeply entrenched in the terrain. Establishing permanent field camps, League commissars direct their conscripts in the blowing of rebel tunnel networks, and the liberal use of incendiary weapons. When night falls however, men turn up missing. They are most usually discovered fighting alongside the rebels, or surrounded by buzzing insects, nailed to the trees. There is no war on Jangala.",
planet_jangala_pirates,CUSTOM,"The coveted jewel of the Persean Sector's Hegemony has been taken by Bandit King Bloodstone, who first cavorted at the chance to strike with impunity at the green gem of the Corvus system, planning to burn the entire globe to a cinder using the Jangala Station orbital laser. But due minimal understanding of the equipment, the impressive weapon is rarely operational, leading to massive overgrowth of the toxic jungle on the once pristine fields and sealed cities of the jungle world. Worse than the lost food, than the lost fortresses and centers of commerce, would be what remains and thrives in the green hell; the appearance of their biohazardous combat gear has led the pirates to call them the Frogmen.",,"The pirates hold no actual ground on Jangala, only maintaining field outposts around landing zones cleared by hand with burners and machete. With a reward posted for the head of any Frogman by the orbital station's pirate king, many have touched down with a serrated knife at hand, ready to retire on a paradise world with an account full of credits. Instead, as dawn breaks, the fresh batch of bounty hunters discover the fate of the last wave. Aside from those fallen in combat or to simple traps, those caught alive serve as a warning to never hunt alone; privateers tied to trees, the seed of a native vine having been forced down their throat, growing out in the span of hours. The reward for the Field Marshal's head is in the millions of credits, yet few dare to hunt such a bounty.",
planet_jangala_sindrian_diktat,CUSTOM,"The Emerald of Corvus proves true the Diktat adage, ""don't do too poorly, don't do too well"", for the capable and those to be punished are served the same fate. Posting on Jangala is not feared for its toxic biosphere, its apocalyptic hurricanes, or the hostile xenolife; it is feared for what remains to challenge the Diktat, an open defiance of The Lion of Sindria's will, the Damned 33rd. Said to have perished and fused with the native flora, they are rumored walking dead retaining fighting acumen they possessed in life. It is even said captives will be taken to the depths of the jungle, fed to the fungi rumored to pilot the soldier's remains.",,"The Ministry of Environment, responsible for preserving Jangala while exploiting its resources to the greatest possible extent, denies any and all rumors of undead dissidents. Even if such macabre gossip is true, Jangala is well worth the danger for the Diktat to hold. Bioengineers from the Ministry of Science and Technology work around the clock creating fantastical new xenolife from the boundless creatures and plants the jungle world provides. These abominations serve as sources of nutrition, beloved pets, and guardians of the elite. Choice species are designed for combat, tailored for pure audacious spectacle. Xenolife deeper in the jungles are sought after, but rarely captured. Ministry scientists impatient with waiting for appropriate escort in search of valued specimens are found on the outskirts of the jungle, burned to bone and gristle. It is rumored the Damned control the jungle itself, keeping Diktat forces alive purely for the sport of hunting those who dare tread the soil path of the forest. Some have claimed to kill a hostile, but the corpse always seems to disappear, reclaimed by the jungle it is part of.",
planet_jangala_tritachyon,CUSTOM,"Tri-Tachyon employees have taken to calling Jangala ""The Green Hell"", not only for its lush but deadly biosphere, but for what remains of the Hegemony defense force of this verdant layer of damnation. Tri-Tachyon Security who've escaped describe them as those with no fear of death, and they have earned the name of Death Rangers in hushed tones around the water coolers. It is suspected the majority Luddic population is supplying said dissidents, as the more faithful residents of the planet have been the most troublesome employees. Claims that the company is desecrating a holy site have been considered in regards to who may be a potential sympathizer.",,"The sealed cities of Jangala now conduct research on how to reduce the toxicity of Jangala's atmosphere, while Jangala Station works overtime burning away the native flora producing the searing venom that layers over the world. Tri-Tachyon employees have taken to using the Jangala Station to strike where the Death Rangers are suspected to hide, an innovative measure that unfortunately has produced no proven results, as the absolute nature of the orbital laser obliterates any trace of a supposed target. Attempts to engage on the ground level have almost completely stopped, as those not killed in combat are discovered in the early morning, just outside the population centers, biofilter masks removed after being strung up on poles.",
planet_jangala_neutral,CUSTOM,"Jewel of the Corvus system, Jangala possesses a lush native biosphere. The world's farms and seas, often hidden by churning cyclones of megastorms, were a major source of organic feedstock, food products, and exotic xenobiological materials. Considerably holy by most Luddic sects, it has been largely abandoned as its population has scattered into the wild.",,"Initially a center of xenobiological study and tourism, exploitation followed discovery and millions of square kilometres were razed and then covered by plantations tended by massive robotic harvesters. But it is no paradise for humans, requiring biofilter masks and a decontamination process for surface visits. The riotous native jungle has overgrown the great cities, the vast farms, making them uninhabitable as the native population attempts to regain control. Small villages attempt to claw back control from the planet it has only so recently regained, various factions clamoring for dominance, among them the fierce Hegemony-aligned Bloodhawks.",

This new business model has allowed Yama to become one of the Corporation's most profitable ventures even if the planet's population is less than thrilled.",,,
planet_yama_neutral,CUSTOM,"Yama scored only marginal viability on the Eridani-Utopia Corporation survey charts, but the nearby fuel facility on Nachiketa prompted terraforming and colonization. Once one of the few places in the sector where people could lead a relatively peaceful life. The quiet farms and great refineries this planet was formerly known for now lay decrepit and irreparable. The remaining fragments of society stuck here can at least take solace in the fact they are trapped on a habitable world while slaughtering each other for territory and resources.",,,
,,,,,
planet_yami_hegemony,CUSTOM,Officials within the Hegemony came to the conclusion that the current military presence within the Naraka system was inadequate after a League raid left the largest refinery on Yama lying in ruin. This moon was deemed safe enough to place a military presence closer to Yama than Nachiketa while leaving the majority of the civilian population unperturbed.,,,
planet_yami_independent,CUSTOM,Independent traders were quick to jump at the chance for their own piece of space when land on this moon was being given away for free. The majority of the planet's structures are warehouses constructed by its residents to take advantage of the tax-free land. Goods often sit here for many cycles before being transported across the sector when prices finally rise.,,,
planet_yami_luddic_church,CUSTOM,"The Church set up a small missionary town on this moon. Citizens from the planet below and throughout the system are welcomed here with open arms regardless of creed or nationality. Conversions are slow and arduous as the Church has had little influence in the Naraka system since the collapse. For now, this quaint colony is allowed to exist due to its charitable donations—some would call it tribute—to the other planets in the system.",,,
planet_yami_luddic_path,CUSTOM,"Fringe Pather groups dot the surface of this moon; most ""buildings"" are actually derelict ships deemed too hazardous for even the Path to continue using. Their internal bulkheads and weapon systems are gutted to make room for colonial necessities like habitation modules and port facilities. At what point the Pathers actually took over the moon is exceptionally unclear but they are unlikely to uproot without a push.",,,
planet_yami_persean,CUSTOM,"League traders have set up a small waystation on this planet, taking advantage of the tax-free land. Masquerading as independent traders their paperwork is barely legitimate enough to not be wiped out for territorial encroachment. Goods often sit here for many cycles before being transported across the sector when prices finally rise.",,,
planet_yami_pirates,CUSTOM,"Pirate and smuggler bases dot the surface of this moon, most buildings are clad in thick armor with windows and exterior lights removed in an effort to reduce their visual and sensor profiles. For the moment the colony's existence is begrudgingly ignored as smugglers from Yami supplement the system's medical supply shortages in addition to recreational drugs.",,,
planet_yami_sindrian_diktat,CUSTOM,"Sindrian merchants have set up a small waystation on this planet, taking advantage of the tax-free land. The main commodity of the moon is AM fuel directly from the Diktat. Other polities in the system care little for the moon, viewing it as little more than a stockpile of fuel to buy from if prices elsewhere spike or to seize in wartime.",,,
planet_yami_tritachyon,CUSTOM,"Small automated mining operations dot the surface of the moon giving off speckles of light beautiful to gaze at from Yama below. The colony's main feature is a leading-edge Tri-Tachyon research lab set under the surface of the moon. The lab's central focus is research into the collapse of the gate network, which has made it one of the few Hegemony endorsed Tri-Tachyon enterprises. ",,,

planet_epiphany_hegemony,CUSTOM,"Once a quiet mining colony, Epiphany was selected for settlement by the heretical leader of an obscure Luddic cult. Epiphany's civilian government was toppled by Pathers during a burst of enthusiasm during the Second AI War. The recent takeover of Epiphany by the Hegemony has left the populace divided. While the Pathers immediately vowed to drive the Hegemony out by force, the more moderate native inhabitants have seen the invasion as a welcome change to constant warfare. Hegemony officers are encouraged to mingle with the populace to build up goodwill and civilian opinion has begun shifting in favor of the stability and security the Hegemony offers. ",,,
planet_epiphany_independent,CUSTOM,"Once a quiet mining colony, Epiphany was selected for settlement by the heretical leader of an obscure Luddic cult. Epiphany's civilian government was toppled by Pathers during a burst of enthusiasm during the Second AI War. After the execution of a minor by a Pather militant for daring to play games on a Tri-Pad, with authorities lacking the capability to understand what the Pather had done wrong, a revolution was inevitable. The newly reinstated civilian government has not aligned itself to any faction, choosing instead to hold on to what little freedom it can grasp.",,,
planet_epiphany_luddic_church,CUSTOM,"Once a quiet mining colony, Epiphany was selected for settlement by the heretical leader of an obscure Luddic cult. Epiphany's civilian government was toppled by Pathers during a burst of enthusiasm during the Second AI War. The Church sought to reign in the Path since the calamity on Mairaath in cycle 82. The capture of Epiphany gave Church officials an opportunity to deradicalize the remaining Pather militants and leaders residing on the planet. While Church missionaries espouse the importance of peace and virtue, their words too often fall on deaf ears. Few Pathers are swayed by the words of the Church they have long viewed as too unprincipled to enact God’s will.",,,
planet_epiphany_persean,CUSTOM,"Once a quiet mining colony, Epiphany was selected for settlement by the heretical leader of an obscure Luddic cult. Epiphany's civilian government was toppled by Pathers during a burst of enthusiasm during the Second AI War. The planet was seen as a natural extension of the League and joined in a similar fashion to Olinadu after a quick but violent uprising. The new government has retained near-complete autonomy in no small part due to the alarming number of Pathers that still reside on the planet.",,,
planet_epiphany_pirates,CUSTOM,"Once a quiet mining colony, Epiphany was selected for settlement by the heretical leader of an obscure Luddic cult. Epiphany's civilian government was toppled by Pathers during a burst of enthusiasm during the Second AI War. The Pathers found themselves swamped by an increasing number of undesirables as the planet’s reputation as a safe haven grew. Inevitably the Path lost its fragile hold on the world, their divine message overwhelmed by the influx of pirates and smugglers, scoundrels without faith or law.",,,
planet_epiphany_sindrian_diktat,CUSTOM,"Once a quiet mining colony, Epiphany was selected for settlement by the heretical leader of an obscure Luddic cult. Epiphany's civilian government was toppled by Pathers during a burst of enthusiasm during the Second AI War. The Interior Ministry has little reason to hold onto the planet besides providing a mere trickle of volatiles to Sindria. However, the hit to their prestige would be too immense to allow the planet to slip out of their grasp. Suppression of ceaseless Pather uprisings has proven to be a bottomless sump for manpower and credits alike.",,,
planet_epiphany_tritachyon,CUSTOM,"Once a quiet mining colony, Epiphany was selected for settlement by the heretical leader of an obscure Luddic cult. Epiphany's civilian government was toppled by Pathers during a burst of enthusiasm during the Second AI War. Luddites make terrible customers for the Tri-Tachyon; however, the underlying civilian populace lacked any strong ideals allowing the company to set up a bare-bones market presence. The planet's dilapidated spaceport has been given an upgrade to something approaching suitability for trade and commerce.",,,
planet_epiphany_neutral,CUSTOM,"Once a quiet mining colony, Epiphany was selected for settlement by the heretical leader of an obscure Luddic cult. Epiphany's civilian government was toppled by Pathers during a burst of enthusiasm during the Second AI War. The planets degrading spaceport and general lack of infrastructure were already clear signs of what was to come. At some point, the trade convoys stopped and the remnants of society fought for what little was left. With no atmosphere or infrastructure to speak of it is only a matter of time until the few people left here disappear.",,,
