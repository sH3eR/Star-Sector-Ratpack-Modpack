A notification flickers on your datapad, indicating a call from Ancyra in Galatia.

- Answer the call from Ancyra.

A man in a crisp uniform appears in holo.

"Captain, you aided the repair of the jump point in Galatia, is that correct?" When you nod your assent, he continues.
"There has been another incident and I have been directed to recruit your aid. 26 standard hours ago, the warp point shrank rapidly, stabilizing at a diameter of 100 meters."

"Trade ships have been limited to entering one by one, but as of five hours ago, the entire warp point is closed. Due to circumstances under investigation, an Atlas-class freighter drifted sideways and has become stuck, blocking off the entire route."

"The Galatian Academy has been working on the problem and asked for reliable assistance, mentioning you by name."
