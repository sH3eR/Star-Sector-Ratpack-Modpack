# Dangerous Games Pt. 2

"Dangerous Games A" must be finished first.

## The Crew

- Elias (death at choice 1 failure)
- Taddese (death at choice 1 failure)
- Mussie (death at choice 2 failure)
- Jorma (death at choice 3 failure)
- Daciana (death at choice 3 failure)

## Intro

"**FirstName**!" A huge hand claps you on the shoulder and spins you around, where you find yourself facing a large, widely grinning man.
"Remember me? Yer the best pilot I've had - that stunt to get us out of Skymoot, right out of the dragon's nest? Epic."
A crude, but professional, sign behind him reads, 'Dangerous Games - Karengo's Galactic Adventures'.
"Like it?" Karengo follows your gaze. "Decided to make this an official thing. Well...an unofficial official thing.
Feds wouldn't understand. Doesn't matter; I need a pilot again, and a good one. Yer ship's waterproof, right?"
  _"Uh, yeah. I think so."_
  _"Of course."_

  _"Sorry, mate. You'll have to find another pilot."_

Karengo laughs. "It handles the vacuum of space, yeah? Yer right, it'll be fine. I've got a group of lads and ladies here rarin' to see some quoijuu in heat, right up close'n'personal.
They've all got their own subpods, so how's about we load up and head out in the next few hours. Good? Good."
 "Oh, nearly forgot. We're headed to ***Deadman's Cove, in Almach. Ain't sure who's in charge over there these days, so we might need to grease some palms. Best to keep your eyes open and shields up***."
### TODO

## Arrival at Destination

- Must be habitable
- Must be colonized
- Must contain ocean

As before, on Skymoot, Karengo guides you down to a landing spot far away from the local government (_special message if player owns world_). "Don't want no interruptions," he says.
Despite days of pressuring, you've been unable to get Karengo to tell you exactly what a quoijuu is, other than the slightly ominous, "the biggest fish".
He sends a file to your ship computer and grins. "Since it's too late to back out now, it's time to fill you in.
Quoijuu aren't the only thing down there; you've also got scyllae, taniwhales, morgawrii, plus some hydrothermal vents, none of which will benefit us if we run into them.
The good news is that there is a path to follow. The bad news is that the only person to make the path public was a bit of a nut.
It's all in riddles, and I haven't been able to make head nor tail of them. Look them over and we'll follow your lead. And don't worry too much about it - what's the worst that could happen?"

  _"Ok..."_
  _"Ok, no problem."_

The adventure seekers, who you've spent the trip getting to know, are getting ready. You watch a nearby pair, Daciana and Mussie,
helping each other out to put on wetsuits, when Daciana catches your gaze and grins. "Bafta, mate. Safe sailing, see you on the other side."
Karengo gives you a signal and you hurry back to the cockpit to fly out, away from safe shoals and over the watery abyss.
At your touch, the <ship> slowly sinks below the waves. As Karengo warned you about on the way over, most of your navigation systems quickly flash red warnings and go offline;
there is some unknown interference that overwhelm your poor ship's sensors, which were designed for space first and water second, or fifth, or not at all.
Minutes tick by as the crew silently watches one of the few sensors still working. A young couple, Balazs and Jorma, uneasily exchange glances.
EIGHT KILOMETERS, the depth meter reads. TEN KILOMETERS. SIXTEEN KILOMETERS. A loud, metallic creak echoes through the ship and Mussie jumps, startled.
Karengo claps him on the back and gives him a signature grin. "Maybe <first> can keep you aboard after this in case he needs anything from a high shelf!" Mussie smiles weakly, but his eyes don't leave the readout.
TWENTY-FIVE KILOMETERS. "This's it," Karengo announces, "Sub up! Let's see what there is to see. And <first>, keep it to passive sensors. Don't want to attrack any undue attention."
The <ship> smoothly descends into the mouth of a massive cave and your visibility, clouded by dark sulfide emissions from the hydrothermal vents at the floor, drops to less than eight meters.
A fan of 10 personal subpods fan out behind you, their communication equipment syncing with yours to display them as blips on your screen.
"Ok <first>," Karengo crackles over the radio. "Lead on."

## Riddle 1

  _(view first riddle)_

No other path may you take\
Oiled skins flash and flicker\
Razer spikes grow from the deep\
Titanic walls crush and smash\
Heed the beginnings to live.

_[move east](#east-bad-morgawrii)_

_[move north](#north-success)_

_[move south](#south-bad-vents)_

_[move west](#west-bad-wall-1)_

### East Bad Morgawrii

Small schools of fish flit past as you guide your small fleet to the east. Out of the darkness, some sort of small whale crashes into your ship, setting off a couple of proximity alarms but causing no damage. It isn't until you hear screaming, distorted by the speakers, that it becomes clear what you just saw; the "small whale" was a just a flipper of something much, much larger.
"Morgawrii!" shouts Karengo, "Turn around! Turn around!"

  _(go back)_

Hauling on the controls, you spin your ship around. Leviathan shapes rise from below, stirring the water around your ship as it speeds to safety.

[failure](#on-choice-1-failure)

### South Bad Vents

Small schools of fish flit past as you guide your small fleet to the south. The swirling clouds of emissions seem to get thicker and thicker, until there's no reason to look at anything but the ship compass. The screen beeps once and a blip disappears.
"Elias?" Karengo asks. "Your transmitter just cut out."
When there's no response, he swears. "Everybody go back." he broadcasts. "Something's wrong."

  _(go back)_

You spin your ship around and hear a loud crunch come from outside - your shields have just impacted something large and solid. The outer lights shine off falling stone and it suddenly it all comes together; you've led everybody through a field of hydrothermal vents that rise for tens of meters off the bottom, obscured by their own noxious clouds.
You guide your ship back to safety, toppling a couple more underwater smokestacks as you go.

[failure](#on-choice-1-failure)

### West Bad Wall 1

Small schools of fish flit past as you guide your small fleet to the west. Minutes pass with no sign of danger, and finally Karengo broadcasts, "Good work, <first>. Looks like this is the way forward."
"Last one there's a rotten fish eye!" shouts Elias, and your screen shows his subpod leap forward and gain on you, followed quickly by others'.
Then, without warning, a proximity sensor goes off at the same time your outer lights show a wall directly in front, stretching for as far as you can see.
"Stop!" shouts Karengo, "It's the end of the cavern! Stop and go back!"

  _(go back)_

Shuttering, your ship comes to a halt mere meters from the endless stone face. With a sinking feeling that has nothing to do with the depth, you turn the ship around and head back the way you came.

[failure](#on-choice-1-failure)

### North Success

You turn the ship to the north and glide it through the abyssal depths. The subpods race forward, each vying to outdo the other, seemingly heedless of the dangers that Karengo hinted at. With bated breath, you watch the sensors until at last the comms flare.
"Woah!" comes Karengo's voice. "I think that's far enough. Which way to we go next, <first>?"

### On Choice 1 Failure

A quick roll call shows two subpods missing; Elias and Taddese never made it back.
A voice crackles over the radio, "It's clear up north!" Somebody, no doubt unimpressed by your navigating, has scouted ahead and found a way though.

## Riddle 2

_(open the next riddle)_

There are stingers in the deep\
A certain death, a dreamless sleep.\
Go to beast that has no bee\
No danger there, just open sea.

_[move east](#east-success)_\
_[move north](#north-bad-tanglevines)_\
_[move west](#west-bad-wall-2)_

### North Bad Tanglevines

Bubbles rush past the thick windows as the group's subpods scout to the north at your direction.
At first, all is quiet. Just as you start to exhale a sigh of relief, twin lightning bolts arc across the
waterscape ahead and the ship sensors overload, blinded by an apparent release of electricity. The systems recover,
showing subpods returning quickly back to the ship. One is missing; Mussie.

_(go back)_

You turn the ship back the way you came and pull up the sensor recording to see what happened. The flash of light
came from viney seaweed, stretching as far up and down as the ship can detect. Evidently, contact with it released
a jolt of electricity that lit up both the vine and Mussie's subpod.

[failure](#on-choice-2-failure)

### West Bad Wall 2

#### If repeat wall encounter

No no no...not again. The proximity alarm wails and this time, you're much quicker to stop the ship...but Mussie
isn't so lucky. His subpod smashes straight into a different stretch of the same rock wall that claimed Elias and Taddese not minutes before.

_(go back)_

Again, you put the ship into reverse and turn around. This is not going at all how it was supposed to.

[failure](#on-choice-2-failure)

#### If first wall enouncter

Small schools of fish flit past as you guide your small fleet to the west. Minutes pass with no sign of danger, and finally Karengo broadcasts, "Good work, <first>. Looks like this is the way forward."
"Last one there's a rotten fish eye!" shouts Mussie, and your screen shows his subpod leap forward and gain on you, followed quickly by others'.
Then, without warning, a proximity sensor goes off at the same time your outer lights show a wall directly in front, stretching for as far as you can see.
"Stop!" shouts Karengo, "It's the end of the cavern! Stop and go back!"

  _(go back)_

Shuttering, your ship comes to a halt mere meters from the endless stone face. With a sinking feeling that has nothing to do with the depth, you turn the ship around and head back the way you came.

[failure](#on-choice-2-failure)

### East Success

#### If second success in a row

"A bee-less beast," you mutter to yourself. "A poet, this writer was not." Turning east, the ship powers forward, cautious but confident. 
Subpods fly ahead, exulting in their agility in the face of the dangerous ocean.
It isn't long until Karengo again radios you. "Knew I chose ya for a reason. What's the next direction?"

[goto riddle 3](#riddle-3)

#### If first success

Cautiously, you turn to the east and power forward. Subpods fly ahead, exulting in their agility in the face of the dangerous ocean.
After holding your breath for what feels like hours, Karengo radios you. "Knew you'd find your way eventually. What's the next direction?"

[goto riddle 3](#riddle-3)

### On Choice 2 Failure

#### If first failure

Karengo sounds a roll call over the radio. Mussie never reports in, and his subpod beacon isn't responding.
"Ah, well." says Karengo, without much sympathy. "You all stay here and I'll scout ahead."
Only minutes later, he's found a clear path east, and you morosly trail the ship behind.

[goto riddle 3](#riddle-3)

#### If second failure in a row

Karengo sounds a roll call over the radio. Elias and Taddese are still missing, and now Mussie has failed to report in as well.
None of their subpod beacons are responding.
"Ah, well." says Karengo, without much sympathy. "You all stay here and I'll scout ahead."
Only minutes later, he's found a clear path east, and you morosly trail the ship behind.

[goto riddle 3](#riddle-3)

## Riddle 3

_(open the next riddle)_

To the north and to the east\
Track my movements like a beast.\
A quick turn right and forward on,\
Come toward me where danger's gone.

_[move north](#north-bad-quoijuu)_\
_[move east](#east-bad-wall)_\
_[move south](#south-finish)_

### North Bad Quoijuu

#### If first failure

Buoyed by your navigation thus far, you make the call to go north, completing the zig-zag pattern.

[goto either way](#either-way)

#### If second failure

Hesitantly, you make the call to go north, completing the zig-zag pattern.

[goto either way](#either-way)

#### If all failures

Disheartened at this point, you make the call to go north, completing the zig-zag pattern.

[goto either way](#either-way)

#### Either way

Subpods, as usual, race ahead of the ship, despite all logic. "Wall to the east!" calls out Daciana,
whose beacon on the ship display starts to move north-west, presumably avoiding the undersea hazard, and joining up with Jorma.
"Hmm," radios in Karengo. "We should be right about on top of it. Send out a ping."
It's almost a relief to send out a pulse to map the surroundings after flying dark for so long.
The result, however, is a surprise. The display maps two leviathan-sized *things* ahead, each over 200 meters long.
Dozens of sets of flippers run along each 80-meter-tall side and hundreds of human-sized teeth line their jaws.
You goggle at the display for a moment, taking it in, and draw breath to call out the alarm
when an eye appears through the ship window, yellow, glowing, alien, and massive.
All at once, you turn and accelerate, shouting the alarm to any who hadn't already realized,
and hoping that you're leaving the leviathan beasts behind. A quick glance at the display shows
at least one subpod following behind; good enough. If one of those rams the ship, nobody is going home anyway.

It's a long while before you slow and turn around. No mammoth sea monster comes out of the darkness, and you take a breath.
"Quoijuu," says Karengo simply.

_[failure](#on-choice-3-failure)_

### East Bad Wall

#### If first wall encounter

Small schools of fish flit past as you guide your small fleet to the east. Minutes pass with no sign of danger, and finally Karengo broadcasts,
"Good work, <first>. Looks like this is the way forward."
"Last one there's a rotten fish eye!" shouts Jorma, and your screen shows his subpod leap forward and gain on you, followed quickly by others'.
Then, without warning, a proximity sensor goes off at the same time your outer lights show a wall directly in front, stretching for as far as you can see.
"Stop!" shouts Karengo, "It's the end of the cavern! Stop and go back!"

_(go back)_

Shuttering, your ship comes to a halt mere meters from the endless stone face. With a sinking feeling that has nothing to do with the depth,
you turn the ship around and head back the way you came.

_[failure](#on-choice-3-failure)_

#### If second wall encounter

No no no...not again. The proximity alarm wails and this time, you're much quicker to stop the ship...but your tracker shows
two subpods smash straight into the stone wall looming in front of you.

_(go back)_

Again, you put the ship into reverse and turn around. This is not going at all how it was supposed to.

_[failure](#on-choice-3-failure)_

#### If third wall encounter

By now, the proximity alarm is familiar to you, as is the solid wall rushing toward your already-slowing ship and
the feeling as the ship's subpod tracker loses two more dots, leaving a single remaining subpod; Karengo's.

_[failure](#on-choice-3-failure)_

### On Choice 3 Failure

Jorma and Daciana never report back in.
"You stay." radios Karengo. He sounds frustrated for the first time, and you keep the ship in place, watching his subpod dot
radiate outwards, exploring.
"Come here." he finally says. His dot has stopped moving, hovering to the south, and you turn to follow, wondering if
this misadventure is finally over.
"It's here," radios Karengo. "Fire off a ping."
You comply, and the display shows a massive object directly below you.

### South Success Finish

You smoothly turn the ship to the right, heading south.
"Should be close," radios Karengo. "Fire off a ping."
It's almost a relief to send out a pulse to map the surroundings after flying dark for so long.
The result, however, is a surprise. The display shows a massive object directly below you...as well as as two leviathan-sized *things* back the way you came, each over 200 meters long.
Dozens of sets of flippers run along each 80-meter-tall side and hundreds of human-sized teeth line their jaws.
You goggle at the display for a moment, holding your breath, but the leviathans seem uninterested. You shudder, imagining
what one of those could do if you'd turned the wrong way.
Your interest returns to the mysterious bulk resting below the ship.

## The Wreck

A 3D holo floats on the console, displaying the smooth lines of a starship soaring down into the depths.
The jagged edges suggest that this is only a part of a much larger vessel, although it's hard to guess at the
size of the whole ship from the fragment.

Your craft moves closer to investigate and you send out another ping, this time more focused, and the holographic ship display
flickers and refines. The outlines of sealed entrances are visible, unnecessary with the ship torn apart as it is.
Sea growth is mostly absent from the hull, to your surprise, except for a radial pattern of some sort of crystal-shaped growth.
Infrared imaging shows a dim glow of heat at its center.

"What we have here, *ladies and gentlemen* or *gentlemen* or *<first>*" breaks in Karengo, "is a Gate Hauler.
A chunk'o'one, anyway. And we're gonna take whatever we want. Let's see what there is to see."

Now that active communication is low-risk, you bring up the video feed from Karengo's subpod as he
floats toward the heat source. Bathed in floodlight, you can see that there are actual crystals
formed on the ship hull, glowing a dull red.

An unknowable something has rent a hole near the crystalline spiral, and Karengo disappears inside.
*The rest of the subpods wait outside, apparently spooked.* "Jackpot!" comes his voice.
"There's an AI core in here! <first>, get closer and let's get this out."

It's slow work, but *the group / you and Karengo* are able to cut loose the *Beta Core*, along with
as much other salvage as possible. The crystalline growth covers everything inside the ship,
making extraction difficult *, but many hands make light work and you end up with a sizable / acceptable haul OR*
*. You wish there were others to help gather more salvage.* At last, you are done.

_(return to the surface)_

Carefully, you navigate back to the surface, the knowledge that you've made it through once doing absolutely
nothing to help with the very rational fear of the depths. Walls seem to loom just out of site,
and massive, yellow eyes seem to appear, then dissolve into tricks of the light.  

It seems ages, but finally you break through to the surface. Karengo smiles, *and only you and he are left to be relieved.* OR 
*and a sigh of relief goes through the crew.*

"Alright," he says. "Let's get back to <planet> in <system>. <first>, kindly be our chariot and haul."

## On return to origin

The crystal-infected Beta Core has been thoroughly inspected since being salvaged from the watery depths of <destination>.
The storage units of the Core were *unfortunately, entirely corrupted* OR *almost entirely corrupted, but your fleet engineers were able to extract one gate code*
OR *almost entirely corrupted, but between your fleet engineers and the members of Karengo's crew, two gate codes were extracted.*

The crystals themselves are unlike anything anyone has seen before, but through somewhat questionable trial and error (although he insists it's genius),
Karengo discovers that, when heated, they amplify the effect of the many recreational drugs he has on his person.

However, they've proven to only grow near a power source that has been submerged in water from <destination>. Efforts to stimulate growth through other means have all failed.
If cultivated, they could significantly boost the effective production of drugs on the planet.
