You understand immediately once you reach the threshold of the next chamber. A massive hallway filled with millions upon milions of cryosleep pods, all neatly arranged like grim collections. The technician joins you, revealing that the vessel has countless chambers like this throughout the ship totaling a ten million people altogether. He continues relaying that the vessel is dormant with its engines remarkably intact and ready for operation. Everyone looks toward you on how to proceed.
