v0.9.3 Save game compatible
	-Added High Scatter Amplifier and Advanced Optics incompatibility to Brawler Energy - It is intended for energy projectiles - TY hidefreek for your commentary
	-Changed the OP needed for Flux Swap to 1 OP for all sizes - Gives another option for larger ships with 1 OP leftover
	-Added a new Hull Mod, Scatter Amplifiers - Lowers beam range by 20% and damage by 10%, allows beams to deal hard flux - Had the idea while changing Brawler Energy

v0.9.2 Save game compatible
	-Changed the effect of Brawler Energy from +damage to +rate of fire & projectile speed - TY hidefreek for noting that +damage affected beams which was unintended

v0.9.1 Save game compatible
	-Fixed an oopsie with the version checker mistakenly having JYD's forum page - TY Resetium for letting me know
	-Changed the crew adjustment on Arsenal Lockers from a flat 20% to a scaling by ship size 20/15/10/5 - TY Seamus Donohue for pointing out that 20% was a bit outrageous for any size above frigate

v0.9 Save game compatible
	-Added dock needed requirements for the following logistics hull mods: Cargo Carver, Cargo Pods, Internal Tank, External Tank, Auxiliary Tank, Auxiliary Cargo
	-Added a new category listing (CJHML) and UI tag (Logistics+) for the hull mods that now require a dock - Having their own tab makes them easily identifiable when refitting
	-Added Exploration Refit and Booster Rockets to the CJHML tab as they already require a dock
	-Added a new hull mod, Arsenal Lockers, that adds 10 ground support by reducing crew berthing by 20% - The reduction in ability to carry marines balances the support - Let me know your opinion
		-TY CV514 for the ideas for the above changes
	-Added a new hull mod, Ballistic Integration, that reduces the OP of large ballistic weapons by 5 through removing 10% of a ship's hull and armor
	-Added a new hull mod, Energy Integration, that reduces the OP of large energy and beam weapons by 5 through removing 10% of a ship's hull and armor

		-TY Tesser for the donated icons for all the new hull mods
	-Updated the image on the forum OP and discord post with the new hull mods		

v0.8 Save game compatible
	-Added a new low OP hull mod, Auxiliary Tanks - Reduces 25% crew and adds 15% fuel storage. Does not stack with Additional Berthing
	-Added a new low OP hull mod, Auxiliary Cargo - Reduces 25% crew and adds 15% cargo storage. Does not stack with Additional Berthing - TY SableDrake for the idea for both
		-Note there is a 10% disparity in these two to balance the 1/2/3/4 low OP and crew counts as a % are much lower than cargo/fuel on cargo ships and tankers 
	-Updated the image on the forum OP and discord post with the new hull mods 

v0.7 Save game compatible
	-Added a new hull mod, Internal Tanks - Essentially a fuel analog for cargo carver - has the same exclusions but it is stackable with cargo carver 
	-Added a new hull mod, External Tanks - Essentially a fuel analog for cargo pods - stackable with cargo pods - same deductions so it really makes a ship unwieldy if stacked
	-Adjusted Faraday cage by raising the hull deduction from 5% to 10% but increasing the flux from 50% to 60% - 5 was too low in retrospect but added 10% to help offset the increase
	-Adjusted PD Pep by increasing the Cr loss from 7% to 10% - 7 was a bit low and after testing 10 does have an effect but not so much it makes it useless to put on a ship
	-TY to SpiralMatai for bringing the above two hull mods in need of adjustment to my attention 
	-Updated the image on the forum OP and discord post with the new hull mods and edited it to be more even
	-Fixed an oversight with the faction's "known hull mods" for those that want the hull mods unlearned at start, it is now updated to include all CJHM hull mods

v0.6 Save game compatible
	-Added a new hull mod, Armor Swap that swaps 1 percent hull for 1 percent armor for 1 OP - While fitting out ships I realized there wasn't anything for 1 OP
	-Added a new hull mod, Hull Swap that swaps 1 percent armor for 1 percent hull for 1 OP - Same as above but not compatible for players that would rather have hull
		-Big Thank you to Tesser who made the icons that I used for the above new hull mods 
	-Added a new hull mod, Brawler Energy that works the same as Brawler Ballistics but for energy bolt weapons. Note: does not effect beams
	-Added the images and descriptions of the new hull mods to the picture on discord and the forum OP
	-Updated the game version to RC-7 to alleviate your OCD triggering mod manager yellow warning :)
		
v0.5.1 Save Game compatible
	-Updated to 0.97a	

v0.5 Save Game compatible* - Note before installing the update uninstall cargo carver, cargo filler or belt armor if you have them stacked on your ships
	-Added a block to prevent Cargo Carver, Cargo Filler or Belt Armor on at the same time - They all take from the cargo of a ship, making them mutually exclusive made sense
	-Increased the % that Flux swap modifies from 5% to 10% - TY Aran1 for your comments regarding this and the above change	
	-Updated the game version compatibility to the current version (0.96a-RC10) - Minor QOL change so the version checker will stop giving you a warning
	-Moved the Exploration Refit hull mod from JYD to CJHM - They will both exist if you have both mods installed until I can get around to updating JYD
		-It removes the penalties from a civilian-grade hull, increases the maximum burn level,sensor and sight range,cargo space and reduces CR loss from corona and similar conditions 
		-In order to maintain these upgrades the ship requires more crew and uses more supplies per month - Essentially an exploration version of Militarized Subsystems
	- Added the image and description of the new hull mod to the picture on the forum OP
	
v0.4.1 Quick Hotfix - Save game compatible with v0.4
	-Fixed a tooltip error with Magiclib - TY Soviet Tom Bombadil for finding it and letting me know

	-Added instructions on how to enable the optional "unlearned" file to the forum op

	-Changed the description of Fetch Deck to better describe what it does

	-Lowered the hull penalty to Stripped hull from 20% to 15% and changed to description to clarify that the bonus effects all types on ammo, not just missiles
	-Added five new hull mods:
		-Nano Hull Repair - Regenerates hull by decreasing overall hull HP - Had some requests from players to make a version similar to the Hiver one
		-Belt Armor - Fills in a ship's cargo with more hull and armor, reduces cargo space and ship maneuverability - Based on R/L navy belt armor
		-Brawler Ballistics - Increases the damage of ballistic weapons, decreases flux use at the cost of weapon range -Inspired by my Brawler Missiles hull mod
		-Flux Swap - Increases flux venting by reducing flux capacity - A personal preference of mine 
		-Adaptive Damping - Increases ballistic weapon range, reduces ROF - Designed to help LMGs and other short range cheap weapons like the Vulcan - Madbadger2 requested and designed 
	-Added an optional hull_mods.csv that if enabled will make all CJHM hull mods unlocked and learned - JYD and CFT were originally this way and I have received requests for a revert
		-To enable: Navigate to data\hullmods located in the CJHM mod folder and either move,rename or delete hull_mods.csv. Now rename the file learned_hull_mods.csv to hull_mods.csv
	-Updated the forum OP image with the new hull mods
	-Added a direct download link to the Version file that mod managers can use to auto-update - Ty Timid for showing me how
	-Added a direct download link to the forum d/l link that bypasses the google drive preview - one less step to get to the good stuff :)
	
v0.2 - Save game compatible with v0.1
	-Changed the description to Fetch Deck to better reflect what it does 
	-Increased the decay of CR for PD Pep from 5% to 7% - better balances it 
	-Increased the added CR decay on the Cargo Pod mod by 10% - Balance tweak that deters using it on combat ships
	-Decreased the OP requirement for Brawler Missiles from 3/6/9/12 to 2/4/6/8 - makes it more attractive when stacking missile mods
	-- TY Madbadger2 for the above ideas
	-Removed some unneeded code on Shield Overclock - a tiny bit less memory load freed up
	-Reduced the Op requirement for Salvaged Shield on capital ships from 25 to 20 - Puts it in line with other base 5 incremented hull mods
	-Added three new Hull mods to the lineup:
		-Weapon Overlock - Increases ballistic and energy weapon rate of fire for increased flux use
		-Sprint Missiles - Increases the speed and maneuverability of missiles at the cost of missile hull HP

v0.1 - Initial release for review, testing and constructive criticism - Not compatible with JYD 2.2 or CFT 1.0 or lower
	-Ported over all but the commissioned crews hull mods from JYD and CFT and the combat engineers mod from CFT as that is integral to two of their ships
	-Changed the hull mods from unlocked at start to standard
	-Added the hull mods as known only to Independents, Pirates, CFT and JYD
	-Changed the Combat adjustment hull mod from giving a flat +50 armor to all to a variable amount depending on hull size	
	-Changed the OP for Combat Adjustment from 1,2,3,4 to 2,3,4,5 - Minimal increase but they are junk hull mods after all
	-Fixed the description of the Stripped Hull hullmod - added it's missing short description	
	-Fixed some spelling mistakes in hull_mods.csv from CFT and JYD- I'm dyslexic and apparently did not use spellcheck when I wrote them whoops :)
