It is capable of extracting energy on an astronomical scale directly from the linked star. Losing control of an active coronal hypershunt without following proper shut-down procedures can prove disastrous."

Designed to bolster a worldâ€™s defense and industrial strength, it stands as a critical asset, with robust defensive systems that safeguard both the facility and surrounding regions. Originally built to meet the intense demands of the Domain, its unmatched production capabilities allow for the rapid assembly of powerful fleets, providing a strategic advantage to any faction in control."
