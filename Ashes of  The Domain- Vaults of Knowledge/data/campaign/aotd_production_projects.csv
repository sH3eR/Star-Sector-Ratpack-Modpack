uaf_restoration_of_noveria,The mother of all carriers,"Novaeria, a brand-new planfor a deep-space exploration dreadnought by the United Aurora Federation. With the Solvernia relegated to home defense, the UAF had designed a new ship to take her place exploring the unknown, sporting state-of-the-art hangar facilities, highly trained servicing teams, and the most advanced sensor networks known to the Federation. Such a massive construction project would normally take decades. Looking over the blueprints, your engineers are confident they can complete it within a few cycles with the aid of your Domain technologies. All that remains is to procure the necessary materials and raw industrial might.",true,false,$uaf_aqq_nova,5,Core construction;Engine construction;Fitting Weapons ;Hangar construction;System adjustments,test1;test2;test3;test4;test5,10000000,,100;25;25;25;100,"ships:100;ships:200,advanced_components:120;ships:200;ships:200;ships:200",Building progress of %s,Novaeria,uaf_novaeria,data.kaysaar.aotd.vok.campaign.econ.globalproduction.scripts.AoTDSpecialProjBaseListener
uaf_restoration_of_solvernia,Rebirth of Solvernia,"Solvernia, the once-proud vanguard of the November fleet, and a symbol of Auroran might and engineering. She stood as a stalwart defender of the United Aurora Federation, putting up fearsome resistance, her all-powerful railguns tearing ships in two, her armor withstanding an unholy amount of punishment. And yet she was brought low all the same. This massive wreck is all that remains. However, your engineers are confident in the research you have done into the Domain of Man. They believe that with your knowledge, the Solvernia can be returned to her rightful glory. They only require the material and enormous industrial capabilities...…",true,false,$uaf_defeated_slvv,6,Core reconstruction;Engine repair;Phanex System Revitalization;System adjustments;Missile system;Hangars;,test1;test2;test3;test4;test5;test6,15000000,,100;25;25;25;100;200,"ships:250;ships:100,advanced_components:120;ships:300;ships:100;ships:200;ships:250",Current state of renovation of %s,Solvernia,uaf_supercap_slv_core,data.kaysaar.aotd.vok.campaign.econ.globalproduction.scripts.AoTDSpecialProjBaseListener
uaf_cherry_constrction,Question of space,"Once carrying the entire expeditionary fleet into the Persean Sector, Cherry Vanguard was the oldest supercapital class vessel in the United Aurora Federation, and it shows. Abandoned after the settling of New Aurora, years of neglect have left her worse for wear. Stripped of many vital parts by the Federation to construct new ships and planetside facilities, she is but a husk of her former self. Only her heart, her Macro Melody Drive, remains. Reviewing the Federation’s historical records, your engineers report that restoring her to functionality is possible, and your Domain technologies will expedite the process considerably. You only need to provide them with the enormous amount of materials.",true,false,$uaf_aqq_cherry,5,Melody Core;Massive cargo holds;Engine construction;PD integration;System adjustments,test1;test2;test3;test4;test5,12000000,,100;25;25;25;100,"ships:100;ships:250,advanced_components:120;ships:200;ships:350;ships:150",Building progress of %s,Cherry Vanguard,uaf_cherry_core,data.kaysaar.aotd.vok.campaign.econ.globalproduction.scripts.AoTDSpecialProjBaseListener
pmm_champion_mk2,New Generation of Champion,"This project, based on rare and costly underworld schematics, involves the extensive modification of a Champion-class heavy cruiser to incorporate a Domain-era Plasma Dynamo. The upgrade focuses on overhauling the ship's energy systems, particularly the ""Crowning"" energy subsystems situated beneath a heavy energy battery. This configuration enables the efficient redirection of flux into the energy grid and the integration of an arc emitter. The familiarity and detail depicted by the supposed author suggest the involvement of a defected high-ranking captain or researcher.",true,true,$pmm_aqq_champ,5,Ship procurement;Engine rework;Dynamo preparation;Hull preparation;Emitter installation,test1;test2;test3;test4;test5,150000,plasma_dynamo:1,100;25;25;25;100,"ships:50;ships:120,advanced_components:60;advanced_components:100;ships:100,advanced_components:50;ships:50",Building progress of %s,Champion Mk2,pmm_champion2,data.kaysaar.aotd.vok.campaign.econ.globalproduction.scripts.AoTDSpecialProjBaseListener
acs_junkhubship_build,To brave the abyss,"Base on premilinary schematic and salvaged document of the ship of Admiral Methuselah, Construction of Djoeng-Class Voidfaring Hubship originally was commissioned by early Domain Pioneering Command to ensure the survival and continuantion of mankind, as a guaranteee that even in the most catalytic event than doom the entirety known human civilization, humanity can continue to persist and prospere in fringe and most isolated and barren part of universe. As such the project involve great amount of resource and specialized domain era relic as neccessary component to construct a vessel that can traverse the abyss without the help of gates system and able to not only survive but also thrive in every possible situation. This include powerful indepedent Shield module designed to protect the whole ship without potentially doom the entire ship if it ever overloaded, a whole dedicated onboard facility and autoforge designed not only to service and maintain the whole fleets but also to produce new vessel and automated defense drones to ensure survivability of the vessel in engagement, and to ensure that even if it to be left alone, it will never be without escort.",true,false,$acs_aqq_junkhubship,6,Frame Construction; Core module; Indepedent Shield Module; Left Barge Module; Right Barge Module; Fleet Gantry and Drone Constructor,test1;test2;test3;test4;test5;test6,12000000,"pristine_nanoforge:1,drone_replicator:1,plasma_dynamo:1",100;25;100;25;100;200,"ships:100;ships:300;ships:100,advanced_components:150;ships:200;ships:150,hand_weapons:200;ships:200,hand_weapons:150,advanced_components:170",Construction progress of %s,Voidfaring Hubship,acs_junkhubship_module,data.kaysaar.aotd.vok.campaign.econ.globalproduction.scripts.AoTDSpecialProjBaseListener
ix_radiant_conversion,Stolen Radiance,"The leftover detritus of the First AI War wrecked havoc upon the 9th Domain Battlegroup during its arrival in the Persean Sector, and cemented among the survivors a healthy respect for the battleship sized Radiant-class automatons. Once open war with the rest of the Sector became inevitable, Fleet Command made capturing and refitting Radiant hulls for the Fleet's own use a top priority. The AI core housing and much of the internal circuitry is systematically removed and replaced with a conventional bridge, living quarters, and life support systems. The shields are then re-calibrated for crew safety. Last but not least, a built-in Soliton Burst Emitter is integrated into the central weapon mount. The result is a converted Radiant that can be operated by a human crew, as one of the most powerful battleships in the Sector.",true,true,$ix_aqq_radiant,4,Bridge Conversion; Life Support Systems; Shield Modulation; Emitter Installation,test1;test2;test3;test4;,750000,radiant:1,50;25;25;50,ships:100;ships:50;ships:50;advanced_components:50,Conversion progress of %s,Radiant (IX),radiant_ix,data.kaysaar.aotd.vok.campaign.econ.globalproduction.scripts.AoTDSpecialProjBaseListener
