This mod makes several changes to elements of the core game, including:

Autopulse Laser firing sound
Kinetic Blaster performance
Lux and Flash drone stats

You can revert any of the changes back to the core game version, or reactivate the modded changes, by going into the "undo and restore mod changes" folder, finding the desired subfolder, and copying the contents to the Emergent Threats main folder. You did the procedure correctly if you're prompted to confirm overwriting files. These changes can be made after starting a new game.
