The Intrepid was the result of bitter compromises between reformers and traditionalists within the Domain Navy, and bears several antiquated design traits such as fixed forward shields and built-in energy weapons that are rarely found on high-tech hulls. Nonetheless, it is a highly capable flotilla leader when its vulnerable flanks are well protected by escorts.",
