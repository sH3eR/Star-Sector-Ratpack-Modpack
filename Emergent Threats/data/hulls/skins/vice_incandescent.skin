	"descriptionPrefix":"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Illegal under Domain (and Hegemony) law, and an abomination to the Church of Galactic Redemption. This ship is clearly derived from the Incursion-class battleship, a proposed but never widely adopted replacement for the venerable Onslaught-class battleships still in service with the Domain Armada. First spotted by deep space patrols less than 20 cycles ago, how this type of autonomous warship came into being remains a mystery. However, its very existence is enough to keep COMSEC strategic planners awake at night.",
