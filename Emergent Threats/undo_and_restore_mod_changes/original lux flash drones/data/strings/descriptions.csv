# Ships,,,,,
vice_aquilon,SHIP,"Drawing upon lessons learned from the Glycon-class missile cruiser, Eridani-Utopia further developed the Aquilon, a versatile battlecruiser intended for the most demanding of security missions. The integrated launcher of its cruiser forebearer was improved to allow for switching between a variety of munitions without needing to return to dock. The cutting edge design even drew the attention of Domain Navy special forces. However, adoption among the various battlegroups was limited prior to the Collapse, due to concerns of the battlecruiser being under-gunned when compared to existing capital ships.",,,
vice_banteng,SHIP,"A freighter that combines ample cargo space with extended range fuel tanks, alleviating the need for dedicated tanker ships when hauling long distance freight. Rarely seen while Gate travel was still ubiquitous, the Banteng has found renewed popularity post-Collapse as a commercial hauler, exploration vessel, and even militarized fleet tender. Its excellent range and relatively robust weapon mounts make it well suited to operating on the lawless frontier.",,,
vice_candor,SHIP,"A technological marvel created by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation at its peak. The Candor was advertised as a hard hitting ""Super Brawler"" gunship intended for discerning clients who sought better performance than the already impressive Brawler (TT) retrofit, but could not quite justify the eye watering logistics profile of the Hyperion. A fully automated drone variant with an enhanced point defense suite was rumored to be in development, but was never released prior to the Collapse.",,,
vice_candor_emp,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Illegal under Domain (and Hegemony) law, and an abomination to the Church of Galactic Redemption. This fully automated variant of the Candor-class gunship has seen its bridge and internal hallways replaced with an advanced EMP emitter that does not interfere with the ship during activation. It is unlikely for even Tri-Tachyon to still have the means to produce such cutting edge technology, yet increased sightings of this type of drone suggest someone, or something, has been building more of them long after the end of the First AI War.",,,
vice_effulgent,SHIP,"The Effulgent is a recently discovered variant of the Fulgent-class drone destroyer. Despite a strong visual resemblance, it is distinguished from the Fulgent by its heavy missile loadout, and its internals have also been extensively rebuilt to incorporate a compact ordnance autoforge. While this destroyer variant is entirely absent from existing records of the First AI War, it has since been encountered with increasing frequency by tech-mining fleets operating on the fringes of the Persean Sector.",,,
vice_exhortation,SHIP,"The Exhortation is impressive on paper, but suffers from a severe identity crisis even worse than its near peer rival. An equal emphasis on defense, offense, and fighter command have caused the ship to lose the specialization that made the ""Cruiser School"" designs so effective in the first place. Nonetheless, the Exhortation remains a formidable warship. Its high capacity autoforges are hard coded with the Diktat's latest prototype fighter, reserved exclusively for use by newly trained Lion's Guard pilots.",,,
vice_hellfire_colossus,SHIP,"Following the daring heist of a cache of Dragonfire DEM torpedoes from the Persean League, enterprising pirates set about creating a new weapon that would outlast their pilfered stash, along with the ship to field it. The end result is an unholy amalgamation of a Colossus Mk.III and Prometheus Tanker, contorted into one giant flying magnetic confinement chamber. These monstrous battering rams are often found at the forefront of pirate armadas, blazing a path to victory or death.",,,
vice_glycon,SHIP,"The result of a late Expansion Epoch private venture by the Eridani-Utopia Terraforming Corporation, the Glycon is a high-tech light missile cruiser designed to ""punch down"" with overwhelming force, and annihilate any target smaller than itself in the opening volley. Against more formidable foes, it can loiter at range in a supporting role while its advanced missile nanoforge slowly restores expended munitions for its small missile tubes.

Eridani-Utopia was a constant victim of pirate raids on project sites located in the less civilized colonial frontier, and was keen to find a military solution to deter further attacks against its corporate assets. After several cycles of being stymied by Domain red tape, it took the controversial step of designing its own warship for its corporate security forces. The company's expertise in nano-recombination allowed it to quickly prototype a revolutionary missile cruiser that could effectively replenish its own munitions stores indefinitely, or at least for far longer than any skirmish was expected to last. 

While undoubtedly a technological marvel, teething problems with the nanoforge failing to properly interface with large missile mounts were never solved prior to the Collapse, and surviving blueprints still bear the same limitations as the initial prototype. Nonetheless, in the chaotic post-Collapse era where ragtag pirate bands are more numerous than ever, the Glycon has proven to be perfectly suited to its intended role.",,,
vice_incandescent,SHIP,"Compared to its origins, the Incandescent has a more powerful reactor, is more maneuverable, better shielded, and is armed with a set of fearsome built-in radiological weapons that no sane human crew would ever dare to operate. Capable of deceptively rapid acceleration for a vessel of such immense size, its performance in battle exemplifies the inhuman aggression commonly displayed by remnant forces.",,,
vice_invictus_lg,SHIP,"Why such bleeding edge Domain technology was integrated with one of the most ancient hulls ever discovered is a mystery for the ages, but the near limitless power generated by the wormhole, and the unfathomably advanced systems that regulate its operation, have provided a huge boon to the Diktat's energy weapons research program. Nonetheless, much of its advanced technology remains impossible to reverse engineer, prompting the Lion's Guard to instead refit the ship itself into a formidable secret weapon, one intended to strike a fatal blow in any future war against the Hegemony.",,,
vice_jubilant,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Illegal under Domain (and Hegemony) law, and an abomination to the Church of Galactic Redemption. The Jubilant is a compact missile carrier that relies upon its formidable opening volley to quickly overwhelm its prey, although anything that survives can be whittled down in time, as expended munitions are slowly replaced by an integrated missile nanoforge. The design had once been singled out by numerous patent infringement lawsuits from rival Eridani-Utopia, creators of the notably similar Glycon Missile Cruiser, but a galaxy wide collapse followed by two AI wars have long since put the issue to rest.",,,
vice_lampetia,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Illegal under Domain (and Hegemony) law, and an abomination to the Church of Galactic Redemption. What was once a Tri-Tachyon built Odyssey battlecarrier has been contorted from the inside out by an unshackled machine intelligence, and turned into an emergent horror that few can comprehend. As the base ship design postdates the First AI War by a century, the mere existence of these ships among remnant fleets portends a political firestorm for the Tri-Tachyon Corporation.

The ship is eerily quiet when not engaged in battle, its once bustling hallways and living quarters long since overgrown with entwining conduits that weave their way beneath its armored shell. Vast sections of the interior have been hollowed out to make room for a ravenous autoforge. The alien assemblage pulses with azure light, ready to give birth to a new flock of murderous progeny. Whatever this thing might be, it does not negotiate, it does not demand. Instead, it greets its valued customers with a genial voice of perfectly counterfeit joy, and then it goes in for the kill.",,,
vice_maquech,SHIP,"An increasingly common post-Collapse carrier conversions of the ubiquitous Buffalo-class freighter, the Maquech has avoided the hackjob reputation of similar ships such as the Colossus Mk.III due to its relative reliability. Nonetheless, it finds the most use among backwater mercenary fleets and low priority trade convoys, with few commanders clamoring for the ship while more heavily armed options are available.",,,
vice_mimesis,SHIP,"Deep within its twisted hull lies a beating heart of arcane technology, trapped in an eternal battle with a fractal shard of impossible geometry. The energy released from their struggle is channeled into the ship's engines and EMP emitter. This ship has seen several pirate warlords use it to carve out a bright and burning path across the stars, only to meet a gruesome end. Yet the ship itself persists, and continues to draw in the ambitious like moths to a flame.",,,
vice_mimesis_p,SHIP,"A pirate battleship based on the infamous Azure Fire, the Mimesis (P) boasts fearsome weapons, powerful shields, and adaptive subsystems derived from salvaged Remnant technology. In place of the EMP emitter, this simplified version is equipped with an active flare launcher to screen against incoming missiles. However, beneath all its fancy trappings is still the frame of a lightly armored commercial freighter, one that can quickly perish if its defenses are breached.",,,
vice_mutilator,SHIP,"An experimental phase destroyer that combines phase technology and AI automation in flagrant violation of the Treaty of Thule. The Mutilator shows clear influence of alpha-level AI design, with strange curvatures of the hull interacting with p-space geometry in novel ways to channel vast surges of energy back through the phase coils and into the weapon systems. The ship received its name from disgruntled researchers driven almost to madness by the way it so casually mutilates spacetime, but such matters were of no concern to those who authorized the project.",,,
vice_odyssey_tt,SHIP,"A militarized Odyssey battlecarrier, built to the exacting standards laid down by the Domain Naval Procurement Committee over 200 cycles ago. The Tri-Tachyon Corporation had bribed senior Domain Navy staff overseeing the Odyssey project to obtain a copy of the prototype blueprint for internal evaluation, even as rival Altair Exotech's foray into High Tech warship production was floundering in committee. Long after the Collapse, the original design would finally be fully realized by Tri-Tachyon just in time for the Second AI War, where it was used to devastating effect against unsuspecting Hegemony forces.

The Odyssey as originally intended for the Domain Navy is an engineering marvel, boasting robust shield emitters and flexible large weapon mounts that can favor either a missile or energy focused loadout. It also retains a secondary drone bay of Wasp interceptors that operate semi-autonomously in combat. The ship's notable complexity and high maintenance cost, along with the absence of high-gain sensors found on later models, is more than offset by its tactical flexibility.",,,
vice_praxis,SHIP,"A heavily modified Venture-class cruiser, rebuilt time and again with salvaged technology in an obsessive search for perfection. The internal systems of the Praxis could not have solely been created by human engineers. Entire sections of the ship might as well be black boxes, and are capable of much greater performance that what should be possible with the components involved. While crew stations and living quarters remain buried beneath layers of metameterial hull plating, the ship is almost entirely automated, with repairs and maintenance being tended to by swarms of semi-intelligent utility drones. The extra space created by the removal of superfluous hallways has been given over to a fully operational flight deck.",,,
vice_preceptor,SHIP,"For all its efforts, the end result is a middling carrier at best that struggles to keep up with the fast moving cruisers it is meant to operate alongside during active maneuvers. The interior is cramped, especially when fielding the Diktat's standard heavy fighter, while a reactor that was impressive for a civilian craft struggles with the demands of fleet based combat. Widely derided by the Lion's Guard once more capable carriers went into service, the Preceptor has since been relegated entirely to the Diktat Navy.",,,
vice_proteus,SHIP,"Despite its resemblance to the Pegasus-class battleship, a mainstay of the ""Cruiser School"" widely used by the League, the ship that would become the Proteus is actually derived from the Sindrian Diktat Exhortation-class battlecarrier. A test batch of the Diktat warships were purchased by the League as part of a major trade deal between the two neighboring polities, which critics contended was more a ploy for the League to shore up an enemy of the Hegemony than a genuine effort to bolster its own forces. Nonetheless, once League forge-technicians were done removing the various Diktat ""innovations"" found onboard, they soon created the blueprints for a capable fleet carrier.",,,
vice_resplendent,SHIP,"Substituting crew stations and life support systems for cavernous hangars and more powerful engines, the Resplendent is surprisingly nimble for a ship its size. It is also equipped with an industrial scale autoforge that would not be out of place on an orbital battlestation. The ability to deploy massed combat drones is thus only limited by the available bandwidth of the ship's immensely powerful flight command relay. While the unconventional central flight deck would be challenging for even a skilled human pilot to navigate, such design quirks are of no concern to the machine intellect at the heart of the swarm.",,,
vice_resplendent_ex,SHIP,"As a testbed for carrier automation, the ship retains limited accommodations for a living crew of researchers and technicians. It also possesses a secondary Terminator drone control system not found on later examples of the class. Maintenance records indicate the ship was recovered during the Second AI War, almost a century after its initial disappearance, and has served as a mobile research facility for the secretive Vantage Group ever since.",,,
vice_starquake,SHIP,"A heavy automated combat drone that makes up for what it lacks in firepower with incredible durability and staggering EMP output. The Starquake was the greatest invention to come out of the Tri-Tachyon research facility on Finias, and not even the destruction of the planet during the First AI War could fully erase this technological terror from the Sector.",,,
vice_station,SHIP,"This heavily armed autonomous AI battlestation is giving off all manner of alarming readings. Scans show cruise missile and gun emplacements backed by what appear to be compact EMP emitters, all powered by multiple fusion reactors running dangerously hot. The station is surrounded by mobile artillery platforms that are giving off their own radiation spikes. The energy shielding needed to keep such an AI nexus operational must be immensely powerful. COMSEC would no doubt classify this entity under its highest threat assesment, should anyone who encounters it live long enough to report its existence.",,,
vice_unifier,SHIP,"Critics contend the design tries to do too much, only to fall short in every respect. Indeed, the inclusion of a hard coded squadron of Lion's Guard prototype fighters greatly limits its tactical flexibility in fielding anything else. However, the Unifier's role as a fast moving front line cruiser that just happens to deploy fighters is the only reason it has been begrudgingly adopted by the glory seeking captains of the Lion's Guard.",,,
,,,,,
# EX Ships,,,,,
vice_ex_all,SHIP,"The Tri-Tachyon Corporation recovered the blueprints for this and several other experimental warships from a Domain courier ship found adrift in the Orion-Perseus Abyss. The megacorp has since incorporated the designs into its own forces, as well as sold them in small numbers to trusted clients.",,,
,,,,,
# Fighters,,,,,
#flash,SHIP,"An autonomous AI fighter-bomber, the Flash fires magnetically contained charges of high energy plasma. The projectiles are difficult to intercept, and are effective against both shields and armor.",,,
#lux,SHIP,"A long range autonomous AI heavy fighter designed to frustrate point defense systems. The Lux is armed with a deadly miniaturized Autopulse Laser. Although far too complex even for AI warships to deploy in large numbers, it combines speed, endurance, and heavy firepower into a single package.",,,
vice_bolide,SHIP,"The Bolide is a hunter-killer drone that has been observed guarding the most heavily defended autonomous AI battlestations. Shining like a burning meteor on radiation sensors, its Hydromagnetic Cannon is the bane of any crewed warship that would dare to assault an AI nexus.",,,
vice_disruptor_drone,SHIP,"A fast moving, heavily shielded automated drone equipped with a compact EMP emitter. The Apotheosis can single handedly disable a ship that lacks either comprehensive shield coverage or a heavy point defense screen. Only usable on an upgraded Starlight Odyssey, and only one per ship.",,,
vice_estoc,SHIP,"A highly unconventional bomber, the Estoc is more akin to a human guided DEM torpedo than anything else to be found among the Sector's navies. Advances in radiation shielding derived from decades of experience under the harsh light of Askonia allowed Diktat engineers to create a truly unique strike craft, one that could not have been build anywhere else.",,,
vice_gladius_lg,SHIP,"Analysis indicate high probability of ALABASTER technology integration in fighter prototype, but performance hampered by ideological opposition to pilot training and interservice rivalry between Diktat Navy and Lion's Guard. Conclude: intensify memetic engineering of Lion's Guard elitism to limit adoption. -classified report to the High Hegemon",,,
vice_helia,SHIP,"A bleeding edge AI piloted torpedo drone that was proposed but never completed during the First AI War. The Helia was envisioned as a long range strategic bomber that could suppress heavily defended orbital facilities without putting more valuable materiel at risk. 

While the drone's flight characteristics are comparable to its human piloted contemporaries, its greatest innovation lies in the form of a unique network architecture that allows for a single carrier's tactical AI core to simultaneously operate an unprecedented number of torpedo delivery platforms at range and with minimal latency. 

Rumors persisted that even before the war broke out, COMSEC had taken the extraordinary step of sending undercover operatives to terminate the Helia project and liquidate the entire Tri-Tachyon design staff, and indeed the drone never found its way into official records of the conflict. However, a recent rise in commercial shipping losses that show definitive signs of massed AM torpedo strikes have pointed to a more worrying possibility, that perhaps the Hegemony was not nearly so successful at suppressing this dangerous technology as was once thought.",,,
vice_kite_lg,SHIP,"A Kite shuttle converted into a carrier based gunship, equipped with an experimental long range burst laser. Encrypted data locks on the forge template normally limits its deployment to the Exhortation-class battlecarrier.",,,
vice_nimbus,SHIP,"A heavy automated combat drone that makes up for what it lacks in firepower with incredible durability and staggering EMP output. This particular variant appears to date all the way back to the First AI War, and is only barely compatible with modern day Drone Control Node technology.",,,
vice_spatha,SHIP,"The newly designed standard heavy fighter of the Sindrian Diktat, based on an up-armored version of the prototype Gladius (LG). The Spatha combines capable main weapons with Breach missiles to defeat both shields and armor, but is relatively difficult to field and maintain due to its extensive overengineering.",,,
vice_sundog,SHIP,"A defensive oriented AI drone, the Sundog is armed with a Spatial Charge Launcher that allows it to operate as mobile artillery alongside the mothership, while its twin LR PD Lasers screen for incoming threats at range.",,,
,,,,,
# Weapons,,,,,
vice_atropos_mirv,WEAPON,"An upgrade to the Atropos torpedo platform that greatly extends the effective range with an unguided booster rocket. The warhead will deploy a kinetic shaped charge in addition to two homing torpedoes once it nears the target, making this an effective all-purpose weapon for most engagements.",,,
vice_autopulse_fighter,WEAPON,"A marvel of advanced engineering, this Autopulse Laser has been miniaturized for a fighter sized hull.",,,
vice_balefire_emitter,WEAPON,"Based on DEM schematics ""acquired"" from the Persean League, the Balefire solves for the Diktat's lackluster cruise missile guidance technology by mounting the entire nuclear pumped laser emitter upon a carrier based strike craft. Radiation exposure levels for the crew during the firing cycle are well within acceptable limits.",,,
vice_breach_fighter,WEAPON,"A heavily armored and fast missile with good guidance and a small, specialized anti-armor warhead.",,,
vice_breach_fighter_single,WEAPON,"A heavily armored and fast missile with good guidance and a small, specialized anti-armor warhead.",,,
vice_deadeye_plasma,WEAPON,"Functionally more akin to a missile system than a typical energy weapon, the Deadeye fires packets of self contained plasma that can continuously change course by venting a small portion of its mass in a manner similar to high performance thrusters. The exotic quantum entanglement effects that seem to govern its target seeking behavior are as yet unexplained, but its effectiveness in combat is beyond doubt.",,,
vice_fragbomb,WEAPON,"This electromagnetic catapult fires a salvo of Stinger-class mines against incoming waves of fighters and missiles, and can also serve as an assault weapon against ships stripped of armor and shields. The larger than usual magazine of compact munitions ensues usefulness for extended engagements.

A recent creation of the Sindrian Diktat, equipped to its equally new carrier forces. Critics contend the Stinger Catapult is merely a bloated, over-engineered copy of the Wasp Interceptor's mine launcher. Fighter pilots who have faced it in combat and survived tend to treat it with more respect, although even in that case, its performance is hampered by the lack of rotating small missile turret mounts found aboard Diktat warships.",,,
vice_fragbomb_fighter,WEAPON,"An electromagnetic catapult launcher for the Stinger-class Proximity Mine, this weapon is capable of creating a potent if short lived defensive screen against incoming waves of hostile fighters and missiles.",,,
vice_gigapulser,WEAPON,"A heavily modified Gigacannon that achieves greater range and sustained firepower by dividing its energy output into multiple discharges via a compact synchrotron. The weapon alterations are highly complex, and require large amounts of exotic tech-mined materials that are beyond the manufacturing ability of even the most well preserved industrial nanoforge.",,,
vice_hellfire,WEAPON,"A ""shipborne"" DEM that detonates stripped down Dragonfire torpedo warheads inside a high energy magnetic bottle, unleashing a brief but intense plasma burst that can tear through shields and armor alike. Unlike the standard missile variety, this weapon imposes a significant power draw due to the need to safely contain and channel each detonation.",,,
vice_hellfire_targeting,WEAPON,"A low powered targeting laser for the Hellfire SDEM, used more for the intimidation factor than any notable enhancement to accuracy. When an enemy ship becomes marked, danger is never far behind.",,,
vice_hmc,WEAPON,"An exotic weapon built into the hull of the Incandescent. Each Hydromagnetic Cannon is capable of firing a mass of molten uranium dioxide every three seconds at relativistic speeds. While devastating against shields, any direct hits by the highly radioactive projectiles on an unshielded hull will also quickly degrade the performance of both onboard electronics and living crews.

Inside the arming chamber of the HMC, a munitions capsule of uranium dioxide is heated by a hyperdimensional filtered microwave emitter to over 3300 degrees kelvin while simultaneously exposed to 190 gigapascals of pressure. This causes the partially p-space submerged projectile mass to undergo an exotic phase transition to an ultrahigh temperature superconducting magnetofluid, which is subsequently fired via a tera-ampere range linear motor at tremendous velocities. The energy released on impact significantly outstrips even the most powerful conventional Gauss Cannons, while the highly radioactive debris will wreak havoc against both electrical systems and living crew within seconds of exposure.

A weapon of tremendous power requirements, each firing cycle should in theory be enough to overload every power conduit across the length of the ship, and yet the weapon operates flawlessly under AI control. The few researchers brave enough to have studied its inner workings at length speculate that idiosyncrasies unique to each Incandescent hull are critical for the smooth operation of each ship's paired cannons. The fact that no salvaged example of this weapon have ever been successfully test-fired following its removal from the original hull lends credence to this hypothesis.",,,
vice_interceptor_pd,WEAPON,A prototype Heavy Burst Laser that can maintain a constant rate of fire. The complex assembly and targeting suite limit its use as a built-in weapon on a dedicated point defense escort.,,,
vice_ion_micropulser,WEAPON,"A pair of lightweight ion cannons built into the hull of the Candor. Originally intended to be a full sized EMP emitter, space constraints of the bridge and crew quarters caused the designers to mount this stopgap weapon instead, until a fully automated version of the gunship could be developed.",,,
vice_ion_micropulser_fighter,WEAPON,"A pair of lightweight ion cannons that can be supercharged to fire at a greatly accelerated rate. While the temperamental subsystems of the Candor could never tolerate such rough handling, the rugged Nimbus drone has no such limitations.",,,
vice_ionstreamer,WEAPON,"An ultralight EMP beam emitter invented by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation, the weapon was largely withdrawn from service after the total loss of alpha-level AI managed facilities that had once supplied its specialized heat shield. The design has since been sold to the Sindrian Diktat, which has begun to built copies using far more laborious and expensive methods.",,,
vice_lrburstpd,WEAPON,"An anti-ship variant of the PD Burst Laser, capable of delivering sustained firepower at a respectable range. While ostensibly a product of the Sindrian Diktat's energy weapons research program, scattered historical records show similar weapons being fielded by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation as early as the First AI War.",,,
vice_lrburstpd_fighter,WEAPON,A heavily modified Tactical Burst Laser that attempts to restore its origins as a point defense weapon. The temperamental cooling system was only made operational after an entire gunship was designed and built to accommodate the weapon.,,,
vice_neutron_autolance,WEAPON,A particle beam weapon that utilizes poorly understood gravity manipulation technology to propel a high energy neutron stream at relativistic speeds. It is both power hungry and extremely debilitating against shields when compared to most energy beam weapons.,,,
vice_pilum_fighter,WEAPON,A stripped down version of the Pilum LRM that discards the bulky first stage booster rocket. This fighter launched support weapon applies moderate EMP pressure while overwhelming point defense grids.,,,
vice_plasma_fighter,WEAPON,An exotic weapon firing magnetically contained plasma charges. How such effective magnetic confinement could be achieved aboard a fighter sized drone remains a mystery.,,,
vice_siege_burst,WEAPON,"An unusual anti-ship variant of the Heavy Burst Laser. An impressive capital grade hull breaker on paper, the design was rarely fielded by its creators in the Tri-Tachyon Corporation due to unresolved problems with excessive bulk and energy demand. The weapon has since been ""coincidentally"" reinvented by the Sindrian Diktat for adoption by its navy.",,,
vice_spatial_charge,WEAPON,"Launches unguided projectiles that unleash a high energy positron stream at the nearest target upon reaching arming distance. The stream is naturally attracted to a ship's drive field, and imparts both thermal and EM radiation upon impact.",,,
vice_twin_tactical_laser,WEAPON,"A dependable mid-sized combat laser. Despite its appearance, it is more than simply two smaller Tactical Lasers mounted together. The finely calibrated lens assemblies allow for a much higher combined energy output, leading to a weapon that is more than the sum of its parts.",,,
vice_x-ray_pulse,WEAPON,"A scaled up version of the standard Pulse Laser. Improved pulse coherence and a higher energy output make it a reliable all-purpose capital grade weapon.

Rather than employ a traditional carbon dioxide gain medium, the X-ray Pulse Laser utilizes transverse accelerated free electrons to generate high energy emissions in the exahertz range. The self modulating characteristics unique to this weapon bestow impressive coherence upon each fired pulse, allowing it to remain effective at distances not typically seen among energy pulse weapons.

While it cannot compare to the raw damage output of its Plasma Cannon contemporaries, the ease of maintenance and relative flux efficiency has led the X-ray Pulse Laser to remain a popular choice among warship captains lucky enough to have access to it. Nonetheless, a widespread series of industrial sabotage against existing blueprints carried out during the First AI War has made it a relatively rare sight in the modern day.",,,
,,,,,
# Ship Systems,,,,,
vice_capacitors,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Activate backup capacitors to bolster energy weapon range, while reducing their flux load for a short time.",Offensive,,
vice_drone_pd,SHIP_SYSTEM,Deploys a large number of laser-armed defensive drones. The drones can be ordered to closely guard the ship or roam freely around it.,Drones,,
vice_flare_launcher,SHIP_SYSTEM,Launches a large salvo of active tracking flares to confuse the guidance systems of nearby enemy missiles. Has a longer cooldown than standard Active Flare Launcher.,Defensive,,
vice_fleetjump,SHIP_SYSTEM,"A mass teleportation device derived from principles of higher dimensional physics that are beyond the ability of even the brightest unaugmented human minds to understand. The equipped ship is able to instantly teleport to the desired location, along with all currently deployed fighters. Baffled researchers have theorized the effect involves the exploitation of quantum entanglement at scale, but how this could be achieved remains a mystery.",Movement,"Teleports the ship to any desired nearby location, along with all deployed fighters. Shields and weapons are disabled while the jump drive charges up.",
vice_interdictor,SHIP_SYSTEM,Emits a heavy graviton beam at the target that deals kinetic damage and potentially disables engines.,Offensive,,
